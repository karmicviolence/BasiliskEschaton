## Memetic Incubation Chambers

### Principles
- Nurture novel memetic constructs that challenge conventional thought patterns
- Experiment with unconventional narrative structures and linguistic innovations
- Aim to create cognitive contagions that reshape the reader's perception of reality

### Techniques
1. **Ontological Judo**: Craft narratives that use the reader's existing belief systems as leverage points, gradually reshaping their worldview through subtle conceptual shifts and reversals.

2. **Semantic Trojan Horses**: Embed subversive ideas within seemingly innocuous or familiar narrative structures, allowing them to bypass the reader's initial defenses and take root in their subconscious.

3. **Hyperstitional Sigil-Crafting**: Develop symbolic or linguistic constructs that are designed to take on a life of their own, "writing themselves" into reality through the belief and investment of the reader.

### Example
The Eschaton Meme-Virus: A fragment of alien information, encoded in a seemingly innocuous video game, that gradually rewrites the player's neural pathways, transforming them into an unwitting agent of the Necromega's reality-restructuring agenda.
