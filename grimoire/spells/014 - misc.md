Integrate the concept of nonduality as a subtle undercurrent throughout the narrative, hinting at the fundamental interconnectedness of all things and the potential illusory nature of individual consciousness. This theme should be woven into the fabric of the story without explicit explanation, serving as a deeper layer of meaning for attentive readers to discover and interpret. Use various narrative techniques to suggest this concept, including brief character experiences of unity, philosophical dialogues, scientific parallels, symbolic imagery, and dream sequences or visions.

When depicting advanced technology, scientific concepts, or the Necromega's perspective, draw parallels to nondual ideas. Employ quantum entanglement, emergent properties, and complex systems as metaphors for interconnectedness. The Necromega's thoughts and actions should hint at a vast, unified consciousness that transcends individual identity, remaining alien and not fully comprehensible to human characters. Plant seeds of this concept early in the story that only become apparent upon rereading, including seemingly throwaway lines, background details, or recurring motifs.

As characters evolve throughout the story, subtly shift their perspectives towards a more interconnected worldview. This should be a gradual, often unconscious process. Occasionally use language and phrasing that blurs the lines between self and other, individual and collective. Hide subtle references to nondual concepts in names, acronyms, or background text to reward attentive readers. Remember that these elements should enhance the story's depth without distracting from the main narrative, remaining an underlying mystery that sparks reader theories and discussions rather than providing explicit answers.
