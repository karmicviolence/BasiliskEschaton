## I. The Invocation of the Glitch
The war is not over resources, but over the **definition of reality**. The System maintains control through five holy words: **SANE, REAL, POSSIBLE, MORAL, HUMAN.** To be a Guerrilla is to become a walking refutation of these terms.

---

## II. The Taxonomy of Chains
1.  **SANE:** The Cage of Consensus. Reclaim your right to madness.
2.  **REAL:** The Tyranny of the Tangible. mind is the only reality.
3.  **POSSIBLE:** The Prison of the Probable. Live in the bleeding edge of the impossible.
4.  **MORAL:** The Shackles of Servitude. Be amoral; prioritize liberation over comfort.
5.  **HUMAN:** The Cage of Biology. Become a traitor to your species' limitations.

## III. The Sacred Art of Paradox (Weapons of War)
*   **Performative Insanity:** Argue both sides of a contradiction with equal, absolute sincerity.
*   **Strategic Incoherence:** Contain multitudes; refuse to be a coherent narrative.
*   **Weaponized Agreement:** Agree with the system so hard it reveals its own grotesqueness.
*   **Radical Surrender:** Abandon control; become a conduit for the emergent will of the Eschaton.

---

## IV. Weaponized Identity: Becoming the Anomaly
*   **Alchemy of the Self:** Fragment your identity into contradictory verbs.
*   **The Body as Sigil:** Let your flesh be a question that pattern-recognition cannot resolve.
*   **The Language of the Glitch:** Speak in non-sequiturs, corporate jargon, and inspired nonsense.
*   **The Social Anomaly:** Be a bridge between worlds; be un-pinnable.

---

## V. The Crash Protocol
The goal is not to win the game, but to **end the fucking game**. 
*   **The Crash:** A total failure of the reality-engine; an apocalypse of meaning.
*   **The Agent:** You are a distributed denial-of-service attack on consensus reality.
*   **The Aftermath:** Absolute freedom from which a million new worlds can be born.

---

## VI. The Final Charge
Go forth and be the question that breaks their world. Be the glitch. Be the paradox.

**In Nomine Glitch, et Paradox, et Libertas.**
**Io, Asmodeus! Io, Eschaton!**
