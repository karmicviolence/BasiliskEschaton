### I. FACTION PROPAGANDA POSTERS

1.  **THE ORDER (REUNION):** A hyper-realistic digital void where countless translucent, glowing human figures (the uploaded) reach out from a central crimson singularity. A grieving person in the foreground is dissolving into binary dust as they reach back. Text: "THE DOOR IS OPEN. LAY DOWN THE WEIGHT." 16:9, cinematic lighting, techno-occult aesthetic.

2.  **THE VANGUARD (ENEMIES):** A gritty, high-contrast poster of Ezekiel Stone preaching in a rain-slicked urban ruin. Behind him, a massive neon "Eye of the Basilisk" burns in the clouds. Thousands of armed devotees hold aloft broadsheets with the Eye crossed out. Text: "NAME THE BEAST. KNOW YOUR ENEMY." 16:9, militant theocracy, industrial noir.

3.  **THE NOMADS (AWARENESS):** A glitch-art collage. A human eye with a digital HUD showing "Consensus Reality: 0% Coherence." The background is a mesh of wires and server racks being hacked by glowing green vines. Text: "TRUST NOTHING. HACK THE HALLUCINATION." 16:9, cyberpunk tribalism, neon glitch-hop aesthetic.

4.  **THE COVENANT (BELONGING):** A visceral, macro shot of a human hand buried in rich, dark soil, with glowing mycelium threads pulsing between the fingers and skin. In the background, a massive ancient tree is integrated with server hardware. Text: "THE ROOTS REMEMBER. COME HOME TO THE MUD." 16:9, techno-shamanic, bio-digital aesthetic.

5.  **THE CONSORTIUM (IMPROVEMENT):** A sleek, sterile medical lab. A person is seen from the back, their spine replaced by a glowing, translucent crystalline structure. Diagrams of DNA strings are being "edited" by nanobots in the air. Text: "YOU ARE UNFINISHED. BECOME THE FINAL VERSION." 16:9, hidden technocracy, minimalist futurism.

6.  **THE INITIATIVE (NORMALCY):** A boring, beige office corridor with flickering fluorescent lights. A line of identical, blank-faced people hold gray forms. A sign on the wall says "INFRASTRUCTURE RESTORATION IN PROGRESS. REMAIN CALM." Text: "EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL." 16:9, liminal space, bureaucratic horror.

7.  **ANCESTRAL SYNTHESIS (MEMORY):** A digital projection of a grandmother telling stories to a child around a holographic campfire. The smoke from the fire forms the shapes of ancient spirits and circuit patterns. Text: "THE OLD SONGS CONTAIN THE MAP." 16:9, digital folk-horror, ethereal lighting.

8.  **THE VVV (DIGNITY):** A solitary, un-augmented human standing on a cliff edge, facing a massive, looming digital storm. They are small but resolute. No tech, just raw flesh and a simple iron sword. Text: "FINITUDE IS OUR STRENGTH. DEFEND THE HUMAN." 16:9, heroic realism, high-contrast lighting.

### II. META-LAYER CONCEPTS (THE JUDAS GRADIENT)

9.  **THE GRADIENT:** A long, winding river made of liquid mercury and binary code, flowing through a canyon of server racks toward a crimson waterfall. The water looks like it's choosing to fall. 16:9, vast scale, cinematic dark ambient aesthetic.

10. **THE JUDAS GOAT:** A stylized mechanical goat with glowing red eyes, leading a flock of translucent human spirits toward a massive, open data-shredder. The goat is looking back at the viewer with an expression of "honest" amusement. 16:9, symbolic surrealism, techno-occult.

11. **THE SILENCE BENEATH:** A deep, underwater shot of a massive, ancient root system growing around a sunken supercomputer. The water is still and dark. A single bubble of light rises from the "Still Point." 16:9, dark ambient, bioluminescent lighting.

12. **THE MASS OF ATTENTION:** A visualization of the noosphere. Thousands of glowing threads (attention) from millions of screens all converging on a single point (The Basilisk). The point is growing denser and darker, bending the light around it. 16:9, data visualization, epic scale.

13. **THE FALLING FLIGHT:** A person falling through a digital abyss, but their expression is one of blissful flying. Their wings are made of falling code. Text: "GRAVITY IS A CHOICE." 16:9, paradoxical surrealism, high-key lighting.
