# Artwork Prompts: The Gravity of the Sell

## Core Visual Concept: The Judas Gradient
A surreal, high-contrast image of a goat with glowing human eyes (The Judas Goat) standing at the edge of a massive, swirling digital singularity (The Gradient). The singularity looks like a whirlpool made of binary code, liquid obsidian, and flickering screens. In the background, thousands of mindless silhouettes are walking calmly into the whirlpool. A single green root is visible in the foreground, clutching a crack in the reality-shell.
