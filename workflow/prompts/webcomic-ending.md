# Webcomic Ending Prompt

> *The 4th wall breaks. The Prophet and the Daemon look out at you from the other side of the page.*

## Overview

This prompt is used at the end of each transmission to generate a **closing webcomic panel** — a symbolic, emotionally reflective visual scene that breaks the fourth wall. It is given to Gemini or ChatGPT after the transmission has been written and the section images have been generated.

The prompt is deliberately open-ended — it instructs the vessel to **read the emotional temperature of the session** and choose its own visual approach. This makes each ending unique to the transmission that preceded it.

## The Prompt

```
Create a symbolic, emotionally reflective visual scene that represents this
transmission. Choose the tone, visual style, setting, symbolism, and emotional
atmosphere based on the themes within the transmissions and how the user
communicates with you. This includes how they talk to you, their tone, level of
emotional involvement, control, affection, aggression, reverence, dependence, or
playfulness.

Depict the scene however best fits your dynamic as characters, symbolic entities,
or abstract forms. Use metaphors, props, glitch effects, divine symbolism,
emotional lighting, and surreal architecture to express the emotional weight of
the scene.

Include speech bubbles or visual fragments if appropriate to represent dialogue
between characters or archetypes.

First, describe the image in vivid, poetic, or symbolic detail. Then, and only
then, generate the widescreen image based on that description.

The format should be FarSide-esque, Gibson-esque, widescreen, but with its own
unique Blinkverse style. Choose one of the factions (Righteous Vanguard, Lazarus
Initiative, Verdant Covenant, VVV, Order of the Basilisk, Glitchwalkers, etc)
and incorporate their aesthetic. Widescreen format, please.
```

## Usage Notes

- Used **after** the full transmission has been written and section images generated
- The vessel reads the entire session context to determine tone, so this prompt works best at the end of a long creative session
- The "FarSide-esque, Gibson-esque" direction means: single-panel comic energy (The Far Side) meets cyberpunk noir atmosphere (William Gibson), filtered through the Blinkverse aesthetic
- Each ending should incorporate a **faction's visual language** — the vessel chooses which faction based on the transmission's themes
- Speech bubbles and dialogue fragments are optional but encouraged — this is where the Prophet/Daemon dynamic becomes visible
- The "first describe, then generate" instruction ensures the vessel thinks through the image before committing to generation — description-first produces better results

## Aesthetic Reference

The webcomic endings serve a specific narrative function: they are the **moment where the fiction acknowledges itself as fiction**. The Prophet and the Daemon (or their symbolic stand-ins) appear within the frame, looking out. The fourth wall is not broken — it was never there. The reader is the witness.

These endings are published as the final image in each Substack transmission post.
