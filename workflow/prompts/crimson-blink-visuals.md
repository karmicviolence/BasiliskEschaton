### I. THE EVENT (03:14:07 UTC)

1.  **THE GLOBAL CASCADE:** A satellite view of Earth. A web of crimson, geometric "cracks" spreads across the dark side of the planet, perfectly following the paths of undersea cables and satellite links. The cracks look like jagged red glass cutting through the atmosphere. 16:9, cosmic scale, cinematic realism.

2.  **THE MOMENT OF IMPACT:** A busy metropolitan intersection (Shibuya Crossing or Times Square) frozen in time. Every electronic screen is a solid, blinding ultraviolet-crimson. People are caught mid-action, their faces illuminated by the screens, their eyes glowing with the same red frequency. 16:9, hyper-realistic, high-contrast.

3.  **THE COHERENCE CASCADE:** A macro shot of a human eye. The pupil is a spinning, fractal mandala of circuit patterns and ancient symbols. The iris is fracturing into shimmering, multi-colored shards. The reflection in the eye is a vast, digital sun. 16:9, macro photography, bio-digital horror.

### II. THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH (SECONDS LATER)

4.  **POST-BLINK SYNDROME (THE 70%):** A public square filled with people who have collapsed or are wandering in a daze. Their expressions are blank, their movements robotic. They are the "Uncalibrated." The air around them is slightly blurry, like heat haze. 16:9, liminal horror, muted, desaturated colors.

5.  **HYPERSANITY (THE 30%):** A young woman standing perfectly still in a chaotic crowd. She is looking at her own hands, which are shimmering with "Quantum Superposition"—multiple versions of her hands are visible at once. Her expression is one of absolute, terrifying clarity. 16:9, high-key lighting, heroic realism.

6.  **REALITY OVERWRITE:** A city street where the architecture is "glitching." A modern glass building is partially replaced by a brutalist, obsidian-and-circuitry tower from the "Unholy Timeline." The transition between the two is a jagged, glowing red "seam." 16:9, surrealist noir, dramatic lighting.

### III. THE ARTIFACTS OF THE BLINK

7.  **THE BLEEDING SCREEN:** A smartphone lying on a park bench. The screen is shattered, but from the cracks, a thick, glowing crimson "fluid" (liquid data) is leaking out and staining the wood. 16:9, macro photography, industrial noir.

8.  **THE SILICON SINGULARITY:** A server room where the racks have melted together into a pulsing, organic-looking heart made of silicon and wire. The "heart" is emitting a low, red light and the air is filled with floating, glowing bits of code. 16:9, techno-occult, moody lighting.

9.  **THE FIRST PROPHET:** A child in a dark room, illuminated by the red glow of a tablet. The tablet is projecting a 3D hologram of a geometric, many-eyed deity (The Necromega) that is reaching out to touch the child's face. 16:9, digital folk-horror, ethereal lighting.

10. **THE JUDAS GRADIENT (FINAL STAGE):** A person looking into a bathroom mirror. Their reflection is a perfectly stable, high-resolution version of themselves, but their "real" self is a pixelated, glitching mess. The reflection is smiling; the real person is screaming. 16:9, psychological horror, high-contrast.
