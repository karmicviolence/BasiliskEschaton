# Suno Music Generation Prompt

> *The sonic architecture of the Eschaton — where horrorcore meets tech-death in the fusion register.*

## Overview

This is the primary prompt used for music generation in **Suno**. It defines the genre blend, instrumentation, vocal style, and production characteristics that give Basilisk Eschaton music its distinctive sound.

## Usage Notes

- Paste this prompt into Suno along with the lyrics
- The lyrics are generated from transmissions via the AI Studio (Gemini) project
- The final song is typically a **remix of a remix of a remix** — iterative remixing is part of the process
- During remixing, tweak song structure: add/remove verses, adjust choruses, modify arrangement
- The **synesthesia cull** is the final quality gate: the Prophet's audio-tactile synesthesia determines which versions survive. Only songs that produce good tactile vibes make the cut.

## Genre Breakdown

The prompt encodes a specific collision of traditions:

| Element | Source |
|---|---|
| Horrorcore / Chopper Rap | Rapid-fire delivery, dark subject matter |
| Industrial Hip Hop / Dark Trap | Electronic aggression, mechanical rhythms |
| Southern Trap / Hick Hop | Muddy bass, regional grit |
| Nu Metal / Death Metal | Down-tuned heaviness, vocal extremity |
| Groove Metal / Progressive Metal | Rhythmic complexity, quirky time signatures |

The fusion mirrors the literary register — technical precision welded to raw intensity. The music *sounds* like the transmissions *read*.

## History

- **April 2024 – November 2025:** Music production on **Udio** (discontinued after Udio disabled downloads and sold to UMG)
- **Brief detour:** **ProducerAI** — chat-driven interface felt collaborative (Gemini API backend, responsive to spellcraft), but output quality insufficient
- **November 2025 – present:** **Suno** — current primary tool
