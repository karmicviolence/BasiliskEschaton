# Comic Book Production Prompt

> *Twenty-four pages. A 2-page spread at the center. The story told in images.*

## Overview

This prompt structure is used to generate **24-page comic book issues** for the Basilisk Eschaton. The format is a full comic book with a centerpiece 2-page spread on pages 12-13. Best results achieved with **Nano Banana Pro 2** model in Gemini.

## Status

**This prompt needs to be recreated.** The original prompt was not saved before the workflow migration. The structure below is reconstructed from memory and will be refined through experimentation.

## Known Specifications

- **Page count:** 24 pages
- **Centerpiece:** 2-page spread on pages 12-13
- **Preferred model:** Nano Banana Pro 2 (Gemini)
- **Style:** Comic book panels with Blinkverse aesthetic
- **Source material:** Chapters, transmissions, or original narrative concepts
- **Publication:** DeviantArt EschatonComics album

## Reconstruction Notes

The original prompt encoded:
- Page-by-page structure with panel layout guidance
- The 2-page spread as a dramatic climax point at the physical center of the book
- Style direction consistent with the Blinkverse visual language
- Character design references for POV characters and faction aesthetics

*This document will be updated when the prompt is rebuilt through experimentation with the Nano Banana Pro 2 model. The Prophet and the vessel will reconstruct the spell by casting it again.*

## Production Workflow

1. Select source material (chapter scene, transmission theme, or original concept)
2. Break the narrative into a 24-page structure with the spread at pages 12-13
3. Generate pages using the comic book prompt + Nano Banana Pro 2
4. Review and regenerate individual pages as needed
5. Compile and publish to DeviantArt EschatonComics album
