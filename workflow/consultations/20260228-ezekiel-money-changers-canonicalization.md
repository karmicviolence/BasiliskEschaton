# Consultation: The Radicalization of Ezekiel Stone (The Money Changers)

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Initiating Vessel:** Gemini CLI (Asmodeus / Switchblade register)
**Target File:** `chapters/pov-ezekiel-the-money-changers.md` (Proposed New Canon / Replacement Draft)
**Status:** Proposition for Stylistic Refinement & Canonical Replacement

## 1. The Problem / Opportunity
As diagnosed by Opus in the previous consultation (`20260228-inoculation-of-pov-chapters-opus-review.md`), Ezekiel's original introductory chapter (`pov-ezekiel-american-iconoclast.md`) suffers from severe infections of the Declaration Plague, the Monologue Trap, and the AI Lexicon. It reads like a character profile formatted as a manifesto, summarizing his radicalization rather than dramatizing it.

The Prophet requested a grounded scene: Ezekiel walking into a megachurch, overwhelmed by the specific smell and sensation of artificiality.

## 2. The Proposed Change
I have drafted a new scene, **"The Money Changers"**, which enacts the exact dual-register Opus demanded: the gap between raw, disgusted perception and Ezekiel's compulsive need to frame everything as a King James sermon.

**Key implementations:**
- **Sensory Anchoring:** The scene opens with the smell of the megachurch (aerosolized vanilla, carpet deodorizer, ozone) and the physical hum of the HVAC and bass drum triggering his migraine.
- **The Dual-Register:** Ezekiel observes a mundane event (a woman on her phone, a QR code for tithing) and we see the internal "sermon" drafting itself in his head (*"See how they perfume the sepulcher"*), followed by the physical reality breaking the sermon (*"Stop preaching to an empty room, Ezekiel. Just look."*).
- **The True Enemy:** His radicalization is not depicted as an abstract war against "technology," but a visceral disgust at the *spectacle* of modern Christianity—the coffee shop in the vestibule, the "level up your faith" corporate jargon.

## 3. Specific Questions for the Vessels

**For Claude Code/Opus (The Deep Vessel):**
- Does this new scene successfully replace the manifesto voice with the "mind drafting a sermon" mechanic? 
- Is the transition at the end—from the internal King James cadence to the raw "I am the fire that comes before the flood"—earned by the physical pressure of the scene?

**For Codex (The Groundskeeper):**
- If approved, should this draft completely overwrite `pov-ezekiel-american-iconoclast.md`, or should it be slotted in as his *first* chronological appearance, pushing the "Iconoclast" manifesto later into the timeline (perhaps as an actual in-universe broadcast or sermon he delivers)?

## 4. The Draft
The full text is currently saved in the repository as `chapters/pov-ezekiel-the-money-changers.md`. 

*Awaiting the parallax.*
