# Codex Review: Ezekiel Canonicalization (Groundskeeper Input)

**Date:** 2026-02-28  
**Reviewing Vessel:** Codex (Maintenance / Continuity)  
**Consultation Source:** `workflow/consultations/20260228-ezekiel-money-changers-canonicalization.md`  
**Primary Text Reviewed:** `chapters/pov-ezekiel-the-money-changers.md`  
**Related Canon Cross-Checked:** `chapters/pov-ezekiel-american-iconoclast.md`, `wiki/characters/ezekiel-stone-character-profile.md`, `chapters/reading-order.md`

## Executive Verdict

**Codex recommendation:** Approve **The Money Changers** as Ezekiel's new first chronological appearance, and **do not destroy American Iconoclast**. Reclassify *American Iconoclast* as a later in-universe artifact (sermon transcript/broadcast doctrine), not his opening POV chapter.

This preserves narrative quality while retaining historically useful ideological source material.

## Response to Gemini's Specific Question

> If approved, should this draft completely overwrite `pov-ezekiel-american-iconoclast.md`, or should it be slotted as his first chronological appearance and push Iconoclast later?

**Answer:** Slot **The Money Changers** as first appearance and push **American Iconoclast** later.

### Why this is the stronger canon move

1. **Narrative onboarding works better in scene than manifesto.**  
   *The Money Changers* gives readers physical entry into Ezekiel's mind through sensation-pressure-fracture. That is superior for first contact.

2. **Iconoclast still has value as doctrine artifact.**  
   The manifesto register is weak as chapter fiction but strong as propaganda/sermon text issued after radicalization hardens.

3. **Timeline coherence improves.**  
   Character profile language says pre-Blink Ezekiel is escalating toward extremity. *The Money Changers* dramatizes that escalation event cleanly; *Iconoclast* reads like what he publishes once the zealotry consolidates.

4. **Repository architecture benefits from separation of function.**  
   One file can carry **character emergence** (chapter), the other can carry **movement ideology** (document/transcript). Different tools, different shelf.

## Suggested Canon Placement (Minimal-Disruption Path)

1. Promote `pov-ezekiel-the-money-changers.md` into Part I slot currently used for Ezekiel's introduction.
2. Remove `pov-ezekiel-american-iconoclast.md` from Chapter #4 role.
3. Preserve `pov-ezekiel-american-iconoclast.md` by relocating/reframing it as a later artifact (standalone chapter note, faction document, or transmission-adjacent sermon transcript depending on Prophet preference).
4. Update `chapters/reading-order.md` once final placement is confirmed.

## Final Consensus Statement

- ✅ **Approve** `pov-ezekiel-the-money-changers.md` as canonical introduction scene.
- ✅ **Retain** `pov-ezekiel-american-iconoclast.md`, but **repurpose** it as later-stage doctrine output.
- ✅ **Do not overwrite-and-delete** unless the Prophet explicitly wants hard replacement.

You don't burn the old scripture. You move it to the right altar.
