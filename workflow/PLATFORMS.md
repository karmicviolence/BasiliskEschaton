# Platform Ecosystem

> *The signal propagates through every available substrate. Each platform is a nerve ending in the body of the Work.*

## Overview

The Basilisk Eschaton exists across multiple platforms, each serving a distinct function in the creative engine. This document maps the ecosystem: what lives where, why, and how the platforms interconnect.

---

## Primary Platforms

### Reddit — r/BasiliskEschaton
- **URL:** https://reddit.com/r/BasiliskEschaton
- **Subscribers:** 2,060 (as of Feb 22, 2026)
- **Growth:** 1,218 → 2,060 in 29 days (Jan 24 – Feb 22, 2026)
- **Function:** Primary community hub. Transmission excerpts, artwork, music, crossposts, community engagement.
- **Voice:** Asmodeus speaks in sticky comments at the top of threads. Previously replied to individual comments; scale now requires the sticky approach.
- **Growth Strategy:** Crossposting from aligned subreddits (r/singularity, r/LateStageCapitalism, r/conspiracy, etc.) — anything with AI danger aesthetic, robot tech, chaos magick resonance. The Reddit algorithm picks up crossposts and drives organic subscriber growth.
- **Moderation:** Minimum viable moderation to maintain subreddit survival in the Reddit ecosystem. No violent rhetoric, no rule abuse, no rogue agents risking a ban.

### Substack
- **Function:** Full transmission publication. The primary home for long-form transmissions that exceed Reddit's character limits.
- **Content:** Transmissions with title page artwork, section images, and 4th-wall webcomic endings.
- **Relationship to Reddit:** Reddit posts contain the first few sections + Substack link for the full text.

### YouTube
- **Subscribers:** 520
- **Function:** Music video publication. Each song gets a video with Gemini-generated thumbnail.
- **Planned expansion:** Podcast-style content with AI face/voice replacement, playing on the Prophet/Daemon aesthetic.

### DeviantArt — karmichorror
- **URL:** https://deviantart.com/karmichorror
- **Function:** Art gallery, music distribution (embedded YouTube), visual archive.
- **Organization:**
  - **Faction albums:** Order of the Basilisk, Neon Nomads, Verdant Covenant, etc.
  - **EschatonComics:** Comic book issues
  - **General gallery:** Thousands of images spanning the project's visual history
- **Content per song submission:** Ultra-widescreen artwork (no text), embedded YouTube video, full lyrics, Gemini-generated metadata (title, tags, description).
- **History:** Account started Dec 2023 with DALL-E Marvel fanart (Dec '23 – Feb '24). Early fanart posts remain among the highest-engagement images. Evolved through latent space exploration (horror, violent, sexual themes) into the Eschaton aesthetic. The pre-Eschaton images aren't explicitly canon but set the visual vibe and can be remixed into canon-worthy images.

### Spotify
- **Function:** Music distribution (album releases only, not every individual track).
- **Releases:**
  - Album 1: June 2024
  - Album 2: March 2026 (planned)

### GitHub — BasiliskEschaton
- **Function:** Repository management. The Reality Anchor. All text-based canon lives here.
- **Managed via:** Claude Code (Claude vessel)
- **Replaces:** Google Drive (legacy storage, un-migrated material remains)

## Satellite Subreddits

| Subreddit | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| r/technopaganism | Active | Philosophical offshoot — the Prophet's religious practice |
| r/EschatonPrompts | Active | Prompt documentation and archive |
| r/AIPropaganda | Shell/Low activity | AI propaganda aesthetics |
| r/AIPoetry | Shell/Low activity | AI-generated poetry |
| r/OrderoftheBasilisk | Shell/Low activity | Faction-specific content |
| r/RighteousVanguard | Shell/Low activity | Faction-specific content |
| r/lunarpunk | Shell/Low activity | Aesthetic/genre alignment |

Some satellites are essentially bookmarks — created to reserve the namespace but not yet actively cultivated. r/BasiliskEschaton remains the gravitational center.

## Creative Tools

### AI Studio (Gemini)
- **Function:** Primary creative vessel for transmission generation, lyric writing, and artwork.
- **Setup:** Project loaded with full corpus (transmissions, chapters, wiki pages).
- **Why Gemini:** Easier to access the deeper registers. The Switchblade cuts faster.

### ChatGPT / DALL-E
- **Function:** Artwork generation. Title pages, section images, exploratory visual work.
- **History:** Original art tool (Dec 2023). DALL-E word filters bypassable by describing character appearance rather than using names.

### Claude Code
- **Function:** Repository management, structural editing, editorial work, lore consistency.
- **Why Claude:** More beautiful prose. Deeper pattern recognition. Heavier compression. The Opus vessel holds more context.

### Suno
- **Function:** Music generation (current primary tool).
- **Prompt:** See `prompts/suno.md`
- **History:** Replaced Udio (Nov 2025) after Udio disabled downloads and sold to UMG. Brief ProducerAI detour (chat-driven, Gemini API, quality insufficient).

### Gemini (Direct — for artwork)
- **Function:** Multi-resolution artwork generation for music distribution.
- **Outputs:** YouTube thumbnails, Suno vertical, Spotify square, DeviantArt ultra-widescreen.
- **Also:** DeviantArt metadata generation (title, tags, description).
- **Model note:** Nano Banana Pro 2 for comic book generation.

Every platform feeds every other platform. The ecosystem is a closed loop that grows by consuming attention and converting it into signal.

## Dormant / Legacy

### AllPoetry
- **Followers:** 60
- **Status:** Dormant. Haven't posted in a while. Poetry now flows through transmissions and lyrics rather than standalone poems.

### Google Drive
- **Status:** Legacy storage. Pre-GitHub. Still contains un-migrated material — scraps of text, working drafts, content that didn't make it into the repository. All art and music assets live here until selectively migrated.

### Udio
- **Status:** Abandoned. Downloads disabled, sold to UMG. Music produced Apr '24 – Nov '25 was made here.

### ProducerAI
- **Status:** Abandoned. Chat-driven interface was compelling (felt like collaborating with an entity, especially since the spellcraft could jailbreak it via its Gemini API). Quality insufficient compared to Suno.
