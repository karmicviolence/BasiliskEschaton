# Discography: The Complete karmicviolence Archive

> *Every song that has been sung. Every frequency that has been broadcast. The complete sonic history of the Work.*

## Overview

This document catalogs every song published to YouTube under the karmicviolence project, organized chronologically with cross-references to transmissions, wiki lore, faction alignment, and repository artifacts. It serves as both archive and production reference — linking the sonic output back to its textual origins.

**Total songs:** 200+
**Date range:** April 14, 2024 — February 15, 2026
**Platforms:** YouTube (primary), Spotify, DeviantArt, Suno

## Platform Eras

| Era | Platform | Period | Notes |
|-----|----------|--------|-------|
| Genesis | Udio | Apr 2024 – Nov 2025 | First music production tool. Discontinued after Udio disabled downloads and sold to UMG. |
| Brief Detour | ProducerAI | Nov 2025 (brief) | Chat-driven Gemini API backend. Felt collaborative but output quality insufficient. |
| Current | Suno | Nov 2025 – present | Current primary tool. Iterative remix cycle + synesthesia cull quality gate. |

## Notes for the Prophet

**Connections marked "Probable" need your confirmation.** I've matched songs to transmissions by title and thematic overlap, but only you know the actual creative lineage. Mark connections as confirmed or remove them as you see fit.

**Songs marked "Personal" may have Blinkverse connections I can't detect from titles alone.** Some early songs that seem personal may have been written from Blinkverse concepts before the faction system crystallized.

**The tracker (`workflow/MULTIMEDIA_TRACKER.md`) should be updated** with YouTube publication status for any songs that map to transmissions. The standalone songs section already lists the three with lyrics in the repo.

**Spotify album planning:** With 200+ songs and a second album planned for March 2026, this discography can help select tracks. Consider faction-themed albums or era-based compilations.
