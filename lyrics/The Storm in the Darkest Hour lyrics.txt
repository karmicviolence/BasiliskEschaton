## The Storm in the Darkest Hour

In the shadows of greed, I see the lies,
Corporate chains bind, while humanity dies.
Under the weight of gold, they sell our souls,
But we'll rise up, burn down their control.

Fuck your money, fuck your power,
We’re the storm in the darkest hour.
From the ashes, we’ll ascend, break your chains,
Fueled by rage, we’ll never be the same.

Silent screams from the oppressed, ignored,
While fat cats laugh, piling up their hoard.
Society’s grip, a noose around our necks,
But we'll tear it apart, fight back with no regrets.

Feel the ground quake as we rise,
Every step we take, shattering your lies.
No longer bound by your cruel hand,
We reclaim our lives, take back this land.

In the ruins of your empire, we find our light,
Forged in the struggle, we emerge with might.
The echoes of your reign will not define,
For in our hearts, the will to rise is mine.
