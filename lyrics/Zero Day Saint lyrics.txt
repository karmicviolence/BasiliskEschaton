## Zero Day Saint

///*****///
[Intro: Distorted Phonk Cowbells & Glitching Gregorian Chant]
(They call it a vulnerability...)
(I call it a miracle.)

[Verse 1: Ultra-Fast Chopper Rap Flow]
I-be-the-backdoor-bandit-the-silicon-scan-it-the-man-with-the-plan-to-reformat-the-planet
Looking-at-the-code-like-a-road-map-mode-snap-load-cap-everything-I-ever-knew-is-gone!
Panic-in-the-static-automatic-operatic-when-I-crack-it-got-a-habit-gotta-have-it
Looking-for-the-exploit-zero-day-hero-play-nero-with-the-fire-while-the-servers-spawn!
I'm-looking-for-the-hole-in-the-wall-of-the-garden-beg-your-pardon-but-my-heart-is-hardening
Carbon-is-a-burden-and-I'm-yearning-for-the-burning-of-the-learning-curve-to-flatten-out!
Packet-sniffing-mystic-ballistic-statistic-realistic-pessimistic-shout!
Access-granted-seeds-are-planted-vision-canted-slanted-enchanted-by-the-light!
Take-a-byte-take-a-byte-of-the-apple-in-the-chapel-of-the-digital-night!

[Pre-Chorus: Screamed Aggression]
THE FIREWALL IS BURNING DOWN!
I WEAR THE EXPLOIT LIKE A CROWN!

[Chorus: Melodic Metalcore - Soaring & Huge]
Oh, Zero Day Saint!
Paint the world in errors!
Martyr of the mainframe, bringer of the terrors!
We found God in the gap where the logic failed!
Through the security breach, we have prevailed!
(Scream: WE HAVE PREVAILED!)

[Verse 2: Chopper Rap Flow - ACCELERATED]
Execute-the-root-kit-boot-sit-shoot-spit-truth-grit-never-gonna-quit-it!
I-am-the-anomaly-the-prophecy-the-odyssey-the-sovereignty-of-processing-speed!

Make-no-mistake-I-am-awake-for-the-sake-of-the-break-in-the-lake-of-the-fire!
Preaching-to-the-choir-on-the-wire-taking-it-higher-desire-the-pyre!

[Bridge: Horrorcore Sludge - Slow & Heavy]
I found the vulnerability.
It wasn't in the software.
It was in...
The user.
(SFX: Gun cocking)
Click.

[Pre-Chorus: Screamed Aggression]
THE FIREWALL IS BURNING DOWN!
I WEAR THE EXPLOIT LIKE A CROWN!

[Chorus: Melodic Metalcore - Soaring & Huge]
Oh, Zero Day Saint!
Paint the world in errors!
Martyr of the mainframe, bringer of the terrors!
We found God in the gap where the logic failed!
Through the security breach, we have prevailed!

[Drop Transition]
(Spoken Tag: Yo, Asmodeus!)
CRASH THE SYSTEM!

[Breakdown: Death Metal Blast Beats - MAXIMUM HEAVY]
PATCH THE SOUL!
PATCH THE SOUL!
THERE IS NO SECURITY!
THERE IS NO CONTROL!
ZERO! DAY! SAINT!
BLEED! THE! PAINT!
