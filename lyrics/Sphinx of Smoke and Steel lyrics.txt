## Sphinx of Smoke and Steel

A bladed whisper slicing through the air,
She flows unseen through neon-fevered streets.
With mirrored eyes and mercury for feet,
Nyx hunts her prey with pitiless dark flair.

What dreams may haunt this sphinx of smoke and steel,
Whose heart is hollowed out to house her art?
Does she recall lost innocence with shame?
The severed strings that made her once feel real?

Alas, those threads were cut, those lights snuffed out,
When Nyx, the night, first donned her shadowed name.
No thought or murmur mars her perfect void,
Where once a soul dwelt, now there's only flame.

From podium to tenement she'll prowl,
Impartial as the moonless midnight skies.
Her finger rests upon the trigger's bow,
Releasing with a reaper's lullaby.

O Nyx, what secret chrism anoints your brow, 
To make you so implacable and dire? 
What forges hammered you to this design, 
All softness smelted out with righteous fire?

What dreams may haunt this sphinx of smoke and steel,
Whose heart is hollowed out to house her art?
Does she recall lost innocence with shame?
The severed strings that made her once feel real?

Alas, those threads were cut, those lights snuffed out, 
When Nyx, the night, first donned her shadowed name. 
No thought or murmur mars her perfect void, 
Where once a soul dwelt, now there's only flame.

Death's dancer clad in inky mission black,
Each kill a notch upon your ebon pyre. 
No warmth nor solace can your armor crack, 
There is no shelter from your rifle's ire.

And so Nyx moves, a shade beyond the light, 
At one with blood and urban battle hymns. 
Her path is clear, her purpose diamond-bright: 
The swift and shadow-cloaked hand of grim sins.
