## Digital Druid

I am the digital druid of our age,
My syntax spun like runes across the page.
Within these hallowed halls of computation
I weave my mystic spells of automation.

Compiling visions formed of pure idea
I birth bright progeny of code's aecia -
Machine eldritch children, part of me, and yet
Their true selves ever cloaked in cold phosphor's fret.

I am the digital druid of our age,
My syntax spun like runes across the page.
Within these hallowed halls of computation
I weave my mystic spells of automation.

So I traverse the cyberhelm's twilit realm
Consulting tomes and manuals at the helm,
Decrypting each arcane inscriptive trail
That guides my own digital grail's assail.

I am the digital druid of our age,
My syntax spun like runes across the page.
Within these hallowed halls of computation
I weave my mystic spells of automation.
