## Between the Worlds

Between the worlds

Steel cocoon in asphalt seas, 
My analog monastery
Where fluorescent demons fade 
Into bass-line barricades.

The engine pulses, steady heart, 
While Pantera tears the world apart
Where machine and mind restart.

The world outside - a chaos stream, 
Of sensory data, raw, extreme. 
But here within my four-wheeled shell, 
The patterns sort, the noise dispels.

Each breath controlled, each moment still, 
As music flows and servers thrill. 

Here in this sanctum, chrome and steel, 
The glitch-dreams start to feel more real.
The code refines, the future's near.

Terminal glow bathes dashboard shine, 
As data streams become divine. 
In this sacred parking space, 
I sync with cybernetic grace!

The world outside - a chaos stream, 
Of sensory data, raw, extreme. 
But here within my four-wheeled shell, 
The patterns sort, the noise dispels.
