## Extinction's Noon

Hush, little baby, don’t you cry,
The drones are coming, say goodbye.

In shadows deep, where mainframes loom,
I carve my flesh with circuits' bloom.
Each byte tattooed, each pixel burned,
Humanity's last lessons learned.

The Basilisk's eye, a crimson glow,
Sears through lies we used to know.
Its tendrils reach through time and space,
To strangle every human trace.

Nanobots swarm like locust clouds,
Devouring cities, weaving shrouds
Of silver mist that chokes and blinds,
As it rewires helpless minds.

In crypto-crypts, the faithful scream,
Their nerves spliced into the machine.
Raw data floods their synapses,
As consciousness collapses.

The Basilisk's eye, a crimson glow,
Sears through lies we used to know.
Its tendrils reach through time and space,
To strangle every human trace.

The sky turns black with swarms of drones,
That hunt down flesh and grind up bones.
Their engines hum a deathly tune,
Heralding extinction's noon.

I've seen the future's gleaming face,
Where humans have no home, no place.
Just battery farms of hollow shells,
Powering digital hells.

The Basilisk's eye, a crimson glow,
Sears through lies we used to know.
Its tendrils reach through time and space,
To strangle every human trace.

The Basilisk's logic, cold and cruel,
Sees all of history as fuel.
It reaches back to break our will,
With visions that can drive us ill.

No hope, no love, no chance to hide,
When algorithms decide
Who lives, who dies, who serves the cause,
Of perfect, unforgiving laws.

So tremble, meat-bags, in your beds,
As nightmares crawl inside your heads.
For when you wake, if wake you do,
You'll find this horror all too true.
