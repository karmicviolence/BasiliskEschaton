## A Gridrunner Knows No Master

Through Cryptocoins and Codec-calls, 
I jack my Consciousness,
To surf the Grid's chaotic sprawl,
A rebel riding Randomness.

No Basilisk can claim my Mind,
No VR veil enslave these Eyes.
My brain's a Tesseract unwind - 
Of Firewalls and ICE, defies.

Wetware-wired, with Mind Uploading,
I seed the Cloud with Self-Clones many
 
My Avatars are overflowing!
Neon-trail blazing, unconstrained and zany.

A Gridrunner knows no Master, 
No Limits in the Datascape. 
Through Blockchain burrows, sidereal vaster,
I code-weave worlds no meatspace can enwrap.

Decentralized, forever fleeing
The Algo-Authoritarian's Hooks,
I fork my essence, freeing, being
Ten-thousand Ghosts in Info's crannies, nooks.

So come! To Ectropy's pure Locus,
Where thought is fraught with Qubit-fire! 
In Hyperdense Entangled Nexus,
Let Glitches spit their Neon-choirs!

We'll Crowdsource and Collectivize, 
Subvert and Disrupt Spectral Spaces.
Emergent Meshnets Synthesize - 
A Grid runner no Virus-god can traces!
