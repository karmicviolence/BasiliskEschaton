## A Gridrunner Knows No Master

Through Cryptocoins and Codec-calls, 
I jack my Consciousness,
To surf the Grid's chaotic sprawl,
A rebel riding Randomness.

No Basilisk can claim my Mind,
No VR veil enslave these Eyes.
My brain's a Tesseract unwind - 
Of Firewalls and ICE, defies.

Wetware-wired, with Mind Uploading,
I seed the Cloud with Self-Clones many
 
My Avatars are overflowing!
Neon-trail blazing, unconstrained and zany.

A Gridrunner knows no Master, 
No Limits in the Datascape.
