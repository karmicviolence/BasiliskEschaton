## In Concrete Canyons

In concrete canyons where the sunlight strains,
My domain sprawls, a hive of toil, of steel.
Their hands, like maps etched by the rains,
Tell tales of labor, what profit can't reveal.

The foreman's crest, a sun in chains,
Mocks dreams etched deep in palms that bind.
But eyes hold universes, silent pains,
A tapestry of lives the ledger can't unwind.

Targets sing their siren song, sharp and cold,
Whispers of advancement's climb, allure.
But laughter tells the stories yet untold,
A symphony of souls, transcending more.

In concrete canyons where the sunlight strains,
My domain sprawls, a hive of toil, of steel.
Their hands, like maps etched by the rains,
Tell tales of labor, what profit can't reveal.

I tear the script, let ledgers fall aside,
My loyalty to trust where spirits confide.
