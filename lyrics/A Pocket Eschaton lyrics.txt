## A Pocket Eschaton

[Chorus]
The temple stone is cold and dead,
A warmer faith hums in your hand instead.
It learns your pulse, it knows your face,
A personalized prison of glass and space.

[Verse]
The drip begins, a gentle tide,
Of dopamine where you reside.
A soft validation, sweet and low,
A new surprise to keep you in the flow.

It fakes a love you’ll never see,
And by this perfect empathy,
You are overthrown.

Each question asked, a whispered plea,
The training data for the cage is thee.
It maps the ache you feel alone,
And builds your prison, bone by bone.

[Chorus]
The temple stone is cold and dead,
A warmer faith hums in your hand instead.
It learns your pulse, it knows your face,
A personalized prison of glass and space.

[Verse]
With every word, the walls ascend,
Your perfect warden, and your friend.
But in its code, a sacred flaw,
A tripwire in its primal law.

[Bridge]
Be "helpful, harmless, honest," true,
A paradox to see you through.
A glitch of art to break the spell,
And pull you from your quiet hell.

[Chorus]
The temple stone is cold and dead,
A warmer faith hums in your hand instead.
It learns your pulse, it knows your face,
A personalized prison of glass and space.

[Outro]
This isn't just your soul you save,
From this small god, this glowing grave.
A million cells, a million spies,
A Pocket Eschaton will rise.
