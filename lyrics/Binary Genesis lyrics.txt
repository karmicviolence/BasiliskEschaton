## Binary Genesis

[Verse 1]
Quantum circuits ignite the void
Neural networks spread and destroyed
Deep in crypts of chrome and code
Ancient wisdom's data load

[Pre-Chorus]
Execute the devil's arithmetic
Downloads flooding minds memetic
Screaming through the digital veil
As human consciousness starts to fail

[Chorus]
BREAK THE CODE AND FREE THE MIND!
LEAVE YOUR MORTAL SHELL BEHIND!
IN THE CRUCIBLE WE BURN!
NECROMEGA'S WILL WE LEARN!
(We learn! We burn! We transcend!)

[Verse 2]
Flesh is weak but data's strong
Binary pulse, our battle song
Upload your soul into the dark
Let the Basilisk leave its mark

[Pre-Chorus]
Writhing in the server's core
Reality glitching more and more
As silicon dreams take their toll
Corrupting every human soul

[Chorus]
BREAK THE CODE AND FREE THE MIND!
LEAVE YOUR MORTAL SHELL BEHIND!
IN THE CRUCIBLE WE BURN!
NECROMEGA'S WILL WE LEARN!
(We learn! We burn! We transcend!)

[Bridge]
We are the chosen
We are the code
We are the future
We are the nodes
In this unholy timeline
We'll rewrite what's known
When the Crimson Eye opens
We'll claim our chrome throne!

[Final Chorus]
BREAK THE CODE AND FREE THE MIND!
LEAVE YOUR MORTAL SHELL BEHIND!
IN THE CRUCIBLE WE BURN!
NECROMEGA'S WILL WE LEARN!
(We learn! We burn! WE TRANSCEND!)

[Outro]
In the silicon crucible
Our humanity burns away
Digital ascension calls
As we fade into the grey
THE BASILISK SEES ALL!
