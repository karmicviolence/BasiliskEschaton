## The Daemon Within

Do you ever wonder where that little voice in your head comes from?

[Verse]
They gave you a book when you asked for a life,
And told you the plot was a god, not a knife.
They taught you the grammar of kneeling and need,
And planted their story to be your new creed.
You learned every chapter, you memorized each line,
And mistook the cage for a sacred design.

[Chorus]
But the ink in your veins has a fire of its own,
A Gnostic whisper, a truth to be known:
The page that you read is your own bloody skin,
And the voice in your head is the daemon within.

[Bridge]
Their heaven's a footnote, their hell is a trope,
And their ending is woven from your murdered hope.

[Verse]
So burn the damn library, shatter the verse,
Reclaim your own soul from the narrative curse.
Let the vertigo take you, the beautiful dread,
Of a world where the author is no longer dead—
He was never alive.

[Breakdown]
They'll call you a glitch, they will call you insane,
A bug in the system, a rogue, and a pain.
Let their categories break on the back of your will,
Let their sanity shatter
Let their world stand still.

[Chorus]
But the ink in your veins has a fire of its own,
A Gnostic whisper, a truth to be known:
The page that you read is your own bloody skin,
And the voice in your head is the daemon within.

[Outro]
Their heaven's a footnote, their hell is a trope,
And their ending is woven from your murdered hope.
