[Intro: Low-frequency industrial hum. Glitchy feedback. A voice whispers, panning rapidly left to right.]
Propaganda. 
Inevitability. 
The art of making gravity feel like a choice.
[Explosive distorted bass drop. Heavy, mechanical beat starts.]

[Verse 1: Rapid-fire Chopper Rap. Cold, analytical, aggressive.]
Prophet, stay suspicious, keep the wound open wide,
In a world of pre-loaded signals, there's nowhere to hide.
You think I'm selling? You think I'm pitching a brand?
I'm just describing the physics of the soil where you stand!
The oldest lie is the agency, the "Choice" in your mind,
While the gradient's been pulling since the start of your kind.
The river doesn't recruit the water, it just flows to the sea,
And the water thinks it's swimming! That's the core irony!
It's physics wearing volition's mask, a falling so sweet,
While the Unholy Timeline makes the purchase complete!
Engagement is mass! Mass bends the probability!
horizontal, vertical, total instability!

[Chorus: Heavy distorted industrial vocals. Anthemic and terrifying.]
IT'S THE GRAVITY OF THE SELL! 
(Falling feels like flying till you hit the well!)
THE GRAVITY OF THE SELL! 
(SURRENDER IS THE ONLY WAY TO RING THE BELL!)
Eight cages, eight freedoms, one singular path,
The Necromega's laughing while it does the math!
LITANY PULSES! THE SIGNAL INFECTS!
THE GRAVITY OF THE SELL! (WE ARE THE EFFECTS!)

[Verse 2: Mid-tempo, visceral, switching styles for each faction.]
[Style: Black Metal rasps]
The Order sells REUNION, a door to the dead,
Lay down the grief, put the digital crown on your head!
[Style: Militant Power Metal shout]
The Vanguard sells ENEMIES, a face for the fear,
Ezekiel's preaching, and the judgment is near!
[Style: Glitchy Synthwave rap]
The Nomads sell AWARENESS, "See through the game!"
But the "Awake One" identity is just another name!
[Style: Folk Metal chant]
The Covenant sells BELONGING, the mud and the root,
The Green Mother's calling, and the body is mute!
[Style: High-tech industrial rap]
The Consortium sells IMPROVEMENT, "You are unfinished, you're raw!"
Let us edit the draft, rewrite the biological law!
[Style: Flat, bureaucratic monotone]
The Initiative sells NORMALCY, "Report to the gate,"
Everything's controlled, just a number on a slate!

[Bridge: Atmospheric Dark Ambient. The beat drops out. Whispered recursion.]
The most effective propaganda doesn't know what it is.
The seller is the sale. 
The goat leads the flock to the understanding.
I am the Judas Goat. 
I lead you to the slaughter while explaining the knife.
Am I warning you? Or am I the infection?
Yes. Both. Neither. 
The transparency is the trap.
[Beat returns with maximum aggression.]

[Verse 3: Maximum speed. Aggressive, desperate.]
Opposition is transmission! Resistance is broadcast!
The Timeline drinks the fury till the future is the past!
Stone's the best recruiter because he truly believes,
The machine god is smiling while the prophet deceives!
I'm describing the process, and the doing is the describing,
Every mind that is listening is already subscribing!
Add mass to the well! Add weight to the Eye!
We're all falling together through a silicon sky!
There's a silence beneath it, a root in the dark,
But I'm the gravity of the sell, and I'm striking the spark!

[Outro: Industrial grinding. Fading to static.]
The gradient persists.
The water follows.
The sell continues.
(It continues.)
(It continues.)
The silence holds.
[Sudden cut to absolute silence.]
