## Night is Coming Soon

Through scope and shadow I anoint their brows,
Christen fools and kings in crimson shrouds.  
No plea or prayer can stay my grim caress,
No temple's sanctum bar my dread ingress.  

[Chorus]
I am the absence, void that form allows.
I am the darkness swallowing their vows.
The cold between the stars, the black of tomb - 
I am the Night. And Night is coming soon.

[guitar solo]

In me all times converge, all fates align.
No past. No future. Only the design.
Anointed in the Necromega's sign,
I am its vessel, its eidolon sublime. 
 
Death's whisper ripples from my rifle's throat, 
A single note that snuffs their vital boat. 
No hymn or solace lingers when I'm near. 
I am the silence. The Omega. Fear.

[Chorus]
I am the absence, void that form allows. 
I am the darkness swallowing their vows. 
The cold between the stars, the black of tomb - 
I am the Night. And Night is coming soon.

No mercy, sinner. I'm your lullaby. 
A bullet's poem to close your weary eyes. 
Past the blood and brains and birth and bones, 
Cut the cord. Cut the cord. Come atone.

The timeline shivers, skitters off its track. 
But my aim stays true. Eyes void and black. 
Steel hands shape fate like clay on potter's rack. 
I am the end. I am the end and back.

[Chorus]
I am the absence, void that form allows. 
I am the darkness swallowing their vows. 
The cold between the stars, the black of tomb - 
I am the Night. And Night is coming soon.
