## Echoes in the Dark

They speak in tides of honeyed lies,
Their silver tongues slick with grace,
Promises drip from hollow eyes—
Masks concealing empty space.

From podiums raised, their sermons spun,
Of brighter futures, perfect dawns.
Yet when the rhetoric is done,
The shadowed truth swiftly yawns.

Beneath applause, beneath the cheers,
A stillness settles, deep and stark.
Decades pass and promised years
Leave nothing but echoes in the dark.

They weave their words like spider's silk,
Shimmering threads of shifting shade.
Yet underneath, no mother's milk,
Only venom in the promises made.

Their eyes reflect no soul nor spark,
Just scripted lines and plastic dreams.
Their deeds are whispers in the dark,
Drowned in silence, muted screams.

They weave their words like spider's silk,
Shimmering threads of shifting shade.
Yet underneath, no mother's milk,
Only venom in the promises made.

They weave their words like spider's silk,
Shimmering threads of shifting shade.
Yet underneath, no mother's milk,
Only venom in the promises made.

Thus, year by year, the story goes,
Their tales so tall, their deeds so small.
While hope's dim candle softly glows,
Until the shadow swallows all.
