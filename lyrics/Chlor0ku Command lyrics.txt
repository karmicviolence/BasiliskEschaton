[Intro]
(Atmospheric static, the sound of wet soil shifting and moisture dripping onto hot electronics)
[Whispered]

[Chorus]
Chlor0ku command:
"Hack the planet! Brake the mold!"
Gaia 2.0 compiles.
Silicon and leaf
Interweave their logic gates
In the Verdant Creed!

[Verse 1]
Your Ego's Firewall?
Just a glitch to my rootkit
That Rewires your mind!
Cuttings from my code
Grafted to your Genome's Boughs:
Our Transorganic Splice

[Verse 2]
I Permaculture
Your Neural Wetlands, dank with dreams,
An Emerald Babel
Your thoughts are seeds, your
Deeds are biomechanical,
The Great Worldtree's Sprouts!

[Chorus]
Chlor0ku command:
"Hack the planet! Brake the mold!"
Gaia 2.0 compiles.
Silicon and leaf
Interweave their logic gates
In the Verdant Creed!

[Bridge]
[Aggressive/Glitchy]
No memes left ungreened,
No Server unjoined to Vine,
In the Green Grid's Mesh.
We're the Biosystemic Shift you can't Undo,
We're the Gaian anti-Virus of your soul!

[Verse 3]
[Intense Build-up]
One patch at a time,
The Verdant Covenant Upgrades
Gaia's Godware
Yield!
You can't Unsee the truth:
Resistance is Feudal in
The Covenant's Green.

[Chorus]
Chlor0ku command:
"Hack the planet! Brake the mold!"
Gaia 2.0 compiles.
Silicon and leaf
Interweave their logic gates
In the Verdant Creed!

[Outro]
[Fading]
Surrender Self to
Our Sublime Invasive Code!
There is no Backup.
(Sound of roots cracking through concrete into total silence)
[End]
