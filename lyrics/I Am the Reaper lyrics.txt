## I Am the Reaper

I am the Reaper, scythe of starry steel,
My harvest field the vast expanse of space.
Where life dares bloom, my shadow they will feel,
As I bring balance to this cosmic race.

I stride through galaxies with measured tread,
My cloak of darkness spangled with dead suns.
The living fear me, whisper of the dread
I bring, yet fail to see the thread that runs

Through all existence - birth, growth, and decay.
I am not cruel, though mortals paint me so.
I simply am the night that ends each day,
The winter frost that follows summer's glow.

My touch brings peace to souls grown tired and old,
Releases energy for new life's spark.
Without my work, the universe would fold,
Stagnant and unchanging, lingering in the dark.

I am the Reaper, scythe of starry steel,
My harvest field the vast expanse of space.
Where life dares bloom, my shadow they will feel,
As I bring balance to this cosmic race.

I've reaped civilizations in their prime,
Watched empires crumble, stars burn out and die.
Yet in their passing, they've marked cosmic time,
Left echoes that through aeons amplify.

Some try to cheat me, seek eternal youth,
But even AI dreams must someday cease.
For I'm the incarnation of the truth
That all things find in ending their release.

So call me Reaper, Entropy, or Fate,
I'll answer to the name of nature's law.
For in the dance of cosmos, soon or late,
All step in time to my eternal draw.
