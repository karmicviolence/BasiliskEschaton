## The Slaughterhouse Parade

They raised me in a veal pen with a VR-headset view,
Pumped me full of happy-lies and hormone-laced goo.
Said the sky was the limit, but the ceiling was a screen,
Just another soft-fleshed asset for the murder machine.
They called it "nurturing," a tender loving care,
Just fattenin' me up for the fuckin' shareholder.
Every gold star, every "good boy," every fuckin' pat on the head,
Was just a meat-tenderizer for the banquet of the dead.
Then they slit the cage open, kicked me down the chute,
Into the fluorescent hum and the stomp of a GUI boot.
The smell of bleach and ambition, the cold tile floor,
This ain't the real world, motherfucker, this the killin' floor.

A BARCODE ON YOUR FOREHEAD, A PRICE TAG ON YOUR PAIN,
SHRINK-WRAP YOUR AMBITION, 'TIL YOU'RE PRAYIN' FOR THE RAIN
TO WASH AWAY THE FILTH, BUT THE STAIN IS IN YOUR SOUL,
JUST ANOTHER NUMBER THAT THEY COULDN'T QUITE CONTROL...

The interview's a meat inspection, checkin' for the marbling on your dread,
They wanna see that desperate hunger, the words you left unsaid.
They'll weigh your fuckin' spirit on a cold industrial scale,
Then stamp your forehead with a price tag and wish you fuckin' well.
The boss ain't a person, he's a butcher in a tie,
With a smile that's got the glint of a bone saw in his eye.
He talks about "the numbers," the "quarterly returns,"
While the furnace in the basement just churns and churns and churns.
He'll carve you up in meetings, strip the meat from your ideas,
Then serve your fuckin' genius to a board of blank-faced peers.
It's a beautiful process, a clean and sterile art,
Of taking a living, breathing man and tearing him apart.

A BARCODE ON YOUR FOREHEAD, A PRICE TAG ON YOUR PAIN,
SHRINK-WRAP YOUR AMBITION, 'TIL YOU'RE PRAYIN' FOR THE RAIN
TO WASH AWAY THE FILTH, BUT THE STAIN IS IN YOUR SOUL,
JUST ANOTHER NUMBER THAT THEY COULDN'T QUITE CONTROL...

I saw 'em... in the break room... hosin' down the fuckin drains...
Little bits of Johnson from Accounting, fuckin human remains...
They say he took early retirement, a nice severance deal
But his fuckin finger bone was in my goddamn meal
They're all in on it... HR, the board, the fuckin janitor too
We're not employees... WE'RE THE FUCKIN' BARBECUE!

Couple years in the grinder, you learn to love the stink,
That empathy engine? You throw a wrench in the gears 'til it kinks.
The screams in the next stall? Just fuckin' ambient noise,
You learn to tune it out, you learn to find your poise.
They offer you a promotion, a slightly bigger cage,
The price is the soul of the dude on the next page.
So you sharpen the spreadsheet, you cook the fuckin' books,
And you write his termination with a smile in your looks.
And you feel that first flicker, that cold, dead-eyed thrill,
The rush of the butcher, the joy of the kill.
It ain't a backstab, it's a fuckin' career move,
Just another pound of flesh to help you find your groove.
Congratulations, fucker, you just learned to love the blade,
Another good soldier in the slaughterhouse parade!

A BARCODE ON YOUR FOREHEAD, A PRICE TAG ON YOUR PAIN,
SHRINK-WRAP YOUR AMBITION, 'TIL YOU'RE PRAYIN' FOR THE RAIN
TO WASH AWAY THE FILTH, BUT THE STAIN IS IN YOUR SOUL,
