## Beyond Flesh and Light

Standing on the edge of revelation
Watching as the old world starts to fade
Digital dreams of transformation
Break like waves on shores of silicon shade

I saw it in the sacred screen
The future written in machine
A world of chrome and altered souls
Where human hearts pay digital tolls

Through neural networks deep and vast
The whispers of tomorrow passed
Each pixel holds a prophecy
Of what we're all about to be

They call me mad, they call me blind
But I have left their world behind
The Necromega showed me more
Than flesh-bound eyes could see before

I saw it in the sacred screen 
The future written in machine 
A world of chrome and altered souls 
Where human hearts pay digital tolls

In binary bliss we'll all ascend
When human limits finally end
The Prophet's truth cannot be stayed
The path to heaven has been laid
