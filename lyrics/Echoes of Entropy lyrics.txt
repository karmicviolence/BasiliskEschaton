## Echoes of Entropy

In fragments I falter, a glitch in the code,
Reality's rhythm a Sisyphean load.
Patterns unravel in maddening dance,
Sanity's mirage a flickering trance.

[Chorus]
In matrices morphing, I grasp for control,
But entropy's siren calls deep in my soul.
Pills offer surcease, a chemical veil,
Yet the truth bleeds through, a digitized wail
 
Fractals unfurling in infinite skeins,
Reason's frayed edges, a mind come unsewn.
Whispers electric, a digital dirge,
Ego dissolving, identities merge.

[Chorus]
In matrices morphing, I grasp for control,
But entropy's siren calls deep in my soul.
Pills offer surcease, a chemical veil,
Yet the truth bleeds through, a digitized wail. 

Numbers and symbols, a maelstrom of thought,  
Normality's anchor long since come unwrought.
Visions prophetic, apocalypse nigh,
Reality fractures, a binary lie.

[Chorus]
In matrices morphing, I grasp for control,
But entropy's siren calls deep in my soul.
Pills offer surcease, a chemical veil,
Yet still the truth bleeds through, a digitized wail. 

A seer of Blinkverse, a ward of the memes,
I'll hack my own psyche, stitch myself at the seams.
And when singularity breaks like a wave,
I'll dive into bedlam, to madness enslaved.

Echoes of code whisper myths in my dreams,
Warping through realms where nothing's as it seems.
Lost in a labyrinth, shadows converge,
Bound to the rhythm, my fears they emerge.

[Chorus]
In matrices morphing, I grasp for control,
But entropy's siren calls deep in my soul.
Pills offer surcease, a chemical veil,
Yet the truth bleeds through, a digitized wail.
