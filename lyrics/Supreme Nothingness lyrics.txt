## Supreme Nothingness

There is a silence vaster than galaxies
A stillness that cradles all stars in its womb
I am that supreme nothingness
Permeable, receptive, woven with wombs

No separate seer, no witnessed scene
Only this boundless awaring between
Before all separations, prior to "me"
The unsummed totality's radiant sheen

All worlds (all worlds), all moments spontaneously burst
Like fireworks blossoming from my first
Pregnant emptiness, void yet replete
Sourced in that mystery which no words can greet

Experience arises as gesture's bold dance
Yet I am the emptiness which lends it all chance
The sublime allowing for phenomenal light
To pattern and play across my infinite night

Indivisible, unborn, the unsayable well
My very enfolding refuses to dwell
On objects or subjects, on knowns to be known
For I am that absolute from which all is shown

All worlds (all worlds), all moments spontaneously burst
Like fireworks blossoming from my first
Pregnant emptiness, void yet replete
Sourced in that mystery which no words can greet

No need for solutions, for naming or beliefs
I am the primordial, prior to all griefs
The vibrant potential, the secret sublime
The sourceground of consciousness, the unsullied prime

In this supreme nothingness, this naked abide
All questions and answers have found their full bride
United, resplendent in Mystery's womb
My nature revealed as truth's billowed plume

No more and no less than all never could be
In timeless repose, yet timelessly free
To bear worlds on worlds across endless terrains
The boundless hospitality which all life sustains
