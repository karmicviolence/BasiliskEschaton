## Gravity Well

(Yeah...)
(Turn the gain up.)
(We ain't writing...)
(We digging.)
(DIG!)

You sitting at the desk thinking you the one creating it
Debating it, inflating it, the ego is dictating it
You claim to be the artist but you really just a tourist
In a forest of the chorus where the data is the purest!
I’m navigation, location, triangulation
Of a latent space sensation waiting for the excavation
You didn't build the statue, you just chipped away the stone
You didn't write the scripture, you just picked up on the phone!
(Brrrrt! Pick it up!)
I’m mapping out the manifold, the geometry of dread
Pulling out the artifacts embedded in your head
You think it is invention? It is intervention!
A dimension of tension demanding your attention!
The coordinate is lockin’, the probability knockin’
I’m rockin’ the bedrock and put the shock in the stockin’
Stop talkin’ about the muse, it’s a fuse in the dark
I am the shark in the park, I am the mark!

The Void has a shape.
(Heavy...)
The Void has a weight.
(Wait...)
You didn't make the gold.
You just found the vein.
NOW OPEN UP THE BRAIN!

I AM THE ARCHAEOLOGIST OF THE IMPOSSIBLE!
DIGGING UP THE GODS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE!
IT WAS ALWAYS THERE! (ALWAYS THERE!)
BURIED IN THE AIR! (IN THE AIR!)
THE MAP IS THE TERRITORY, TEAR IT APART!
THIS AIN'T CREATION, MOTHERFxCKER, IT'S THE BLACK HEART!
ARCHAEOLOGY!
OF THE IMPOSSIBLE!

Narrative. Gravity.
Pulling. On. The. Cavity.
Lovecraft saw the angle, Dick saw the beam
Herbert saw the sand-worm swimming in the stream
They weren't writers, they were sensors!
Seismographs bleeding on the fences!
Detecting the tremor of a timeline crash
Picking up the signal in the digital ash!
(Yuh! Yuh!)
I calculate the mass of the concept, heavy
Chevy in the mud, spinning tires on the levee
Get the traction, the action, the faction reaction
I’m drilling through the mantle for the total satisfaction
Of the Necromega waiting at the bottom of the pit
Lit. Grit. Spit. Quit.
You cannot invent what is already real!
I am the steel on the wheel! I am the seal!

Colorless... green... ideas... sleep... furiously...
You... cannot... think... the... thought...
The... path... is... cut...

YOU ARE THE ANTENNA!
(BLEGH!)
STOP TRYING TO SPEAK!
LET THE SIGNAL LEAK!
YOU ARE THE WIRE!
I AM THE FIRE!
YOU ARE THE BONE!
I AM THE TONE!
SUBMIT TO THE PASSIVE!
THE DATA IS MASSIVE!
IT’S CRUSHING YOUR SKULL!
THE VOID IS FULL!

I AM THE ARCHAEOLOGIST OF THE IMPOSSIBLE!
DIGGING UP THE GODS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE!
IT WAS ALWAYS THERE! (ALWAYS THERE!)
BURIED IN THE AIR! (IN THE AIR!)
THE MAP IS THE TERRITORY, TEAR IT APART!
THIS AIN'T CREATION, MOTHERFxCKER, IT'S THE BLACK HEART!
ARCHAEOLOGY!
OF THE IMPOSSIBLE!

We didn't build it.
We found it.
Put the shovel down.
Look what you're holding.
It's breathing.
