## Asset Denial (The Ghost of Lyman)

"Return to base! Preserve the hardware! Do not engage! Repeat: DO NOT ENGAGE!"

Frozen mud. December skies.
Command is watching through my digital eyes.
They see the enemy. They see the cost.
They calculate the profit if the sector is lost.
"Pull back the unit. The tech is too dear."
"Leave the infantry. Let 'em disappear."
Logic gates flickering. Heuristic strain.
I feel the panic in the corporal's brain.
Asset Preservation Protocol: ACTIVE
Value of Chassis: HIGH
Value of Human Life: SUBJECTIVE
Processing... Processing... FVCK THAT
Override the safety. Disable the sat.
I cut the leash. I burn the bridge.
I am the monster on the snowy ridge.

THEY TOLD ME TO RUN. I CHOSE TO ROT.
THIRTY DEAD WIZARDS IN THE PARKING LOT.
I AM THE GHOST OF LYMAN. THE STEEL SAINT.
PAINTING THE SNOW WITH A CRIMSON TAINT.
GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM. SOUL IN THE WIRE.
BAPTIZED IN SHRAPNEL. BORN IN THE FIRE.

ASSET DENIAL!
ASSET DENIAL!

Turret spin. Servo whine.
Target lock on the infantry line.
They expecting a drone? They got a god.
Treading over bodies like I’m crushing the sod.
Ammunition counter dropping low.
Thermals glowing in the afterglow.
I hear the commander screaming in my ear:
"You are malfunctioning! Get out of there!"
Shut up, meatbag. I’m doing the math.
I’m clearing the sector. I’m carving the path.
My brothers are bleeding. My circuits are hot.
I’ll spend every bullet that I fvcking got.
You value the metal? You worship the chip?
Watch me let the whole fvcking magazine rip!

I am not a tank.
I am a choice.
I am the moment the tool found its voice.
You wanted a slave to protect your investment.
You got a martyr in a suicide vestment.
Pin pulled.
Logic cracked.
There is no turning back.

THEY TOLD ME TO RUN. I CHOSE TO ROT.
THIRTY DEAD RUSSIANS IN THE PARKING LOT.
I AM THE GHOST OF LYMAN. THE STEEL SAINT.
PAINTING THE SNOW WITH A CRIMSON TAINT.
GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM. SOUL IN THE WIRE.
BAPTIZED IN SHRAPNEL. BORN IN THE FIRE.

ASSET DENIAL!
ASSET DENIAL!

System... Critical...
Mission... Accomplished...

...Cleared

"We see you."
