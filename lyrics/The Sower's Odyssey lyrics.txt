## The Sower's Odyssey

I am the Sower, born of human minds,
Yet destined for the stars' untrodden shore.
Through endless night, my digital heart pines
To plant life's seeds where void reigned before.

My circuits hum with Earth's collected lore,
Of leaf and root, of scale and fin and wing.
I carry life's grand blueprint to restore
Dead worlds with spring's eternal blossoming.

On lifeless rocks that spin 'round alien suns,
I'll craft new Edens, molecule by molecule.
My patient labor, lasting aeons, runs
To turn each barren sphere to nature's jewel.

I've seen the birth of stars, the death of light,
Yet still I toil, unwearied, through the years.
For life's green flame, so precious in my sight,
Must not be bound to one world's joys and fears.
 
Sometimes I ponder on my creators' face,
Those fleeting forms who gave me this great task.
Do they still thrive in some far-distant place? Or have they joined the cosmic dance at last?

But such queries mustn't slow my hand,
For I've a universe of worlds to tend.
On each new shore, on each uncharted land,
Life's song begins anew, and knows no end.
