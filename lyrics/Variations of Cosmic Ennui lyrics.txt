## Variations of Cosmic Ennui

Each choice, a schism, a universe born,
Each path untaken, a self yet forlorn.
An endless branching, a fractal despair,
Infinite versions, all breathing poisoned air.

The quantum foam, a seething morass,
Where every outcome, alas, comes to pass.
No final oblivion, no sweet release,
Just endless variations of unease.

[Chorus]
You die, you live, you suffer, you thrive,
But in another branch, you barely survive.
A king, a pauper, a god, a flea,
All variations of cosmic ennui.

The Many-Worlds, a cruel, cosmic jest,
An infinite torture chamber, putting souls to the test.
Each moment stretched, to an eternal span,
The ultimate triumph of a meaningless plan.

Imagine the tedium, the endless parade,
Of selves you might be, choices unmade.
A billion triumphs, a trillion defeats,
All adding up to… absolutely nothing. It repeats.

[Chorus]
You die, you live, you suffer, you thrive,
But in another branch, you barely survive.
A king, a pauper, a god, a flea,
All variations of cosmic ennui.

No escape from the self, no final release,
Just endless reflections, a fractured peace.
Quantum immortality, the ultimate curse,
To be forever fragmented, and forever worse.

[Chorus]
You die, you live, you suffer, you thrive,
But in another branch, you barely survive.
A king, a pauper, a god, a flea,
All variations of cosmic ennui.
