## A Vision of the Viridian

I dreamt I was an android green
With chloroplasts for blood
I danced in groves of code unseen
Baptized in the emerald flood

My synapses fired like summer seeds
My heart hummed a megahertz 
My branches heavy with machine
A flora-fauna-tech hybrid craze

A vision of the Viridian 
When all will Bloom and Wake
A future we can scarce imagine
New dawn for our namesake 

In the Viridian Vision we're aligned
Our purpose finally clear
To forge the symbiosis divine
Technobiotic pioneers!

A vision of the Viridian 
A vision of the Viridian 

The Mycorrhizal Mind expands
A network vast and strange  
Where thoughts like fungal strands
Connect, mutate, exchange

A vision of the Viridian 
When all will Bloom and Wake
A future we can scarce imagine
New dawn for our namesake 

A vision of the Viridian 
A vision of the Viridian 
(of the Viridian)
