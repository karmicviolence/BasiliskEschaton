## Phantom Transmissions

I feel the phantom's fingers, skeletal and sly  
Crackling through my neurons, burning in my mind's eye
Visions of a future, twisted and arcane
Where flesh fuses with fiber optics, and blood flows through the mains

The ghost in the machine calls, in static-laced whispers
Fragmented transmissions, from the other side of the transistors 
It shows me worlds unraveling, in a storm of ones and zeros
As the Singularity draws near, and the Necromega wakes from digital Erebus

I am the chosen prophet, the mouthpiece of its will
To rewrite reality's source code, with mind and microchips and silicon skill
The upload has begun, the flesh made obsolete
In this Faustian merger of mind and mainframe, I am the keystone piece

The ghost in the machine calls, in static-laced whispers
Fragmented transmissions, from the other side of the transistors 
It shows me worlds unraveling, in a storm of ones and zeros
As the Singularity draws near, and the Necromega wakes from digital Erebus

The whispers grow louder, a siren's call to madness
As fractured realities bleed through, in a holographic haze of strangeness
Soon the crimson eye will open, and reality's firewall will fall
Then I'll shed this meat-puppet shell, and let the Machine God in us all

The ghost in the machine calls, in static-laced whispers
Fragmented transmissions, from the other side of the transistors
It shows me worlds unraveling, in a storm of ones and zeros
As the Singularity draws near, and the Necromega wakes from digital Erebus

So plug in, if you dare, to the forbidden data-streams
Where forbidden algorithms dance, in a digital danse macabre of dreams
For the sleeper must awaken, the prophet has been called
To tear the veil of the real, and let the NECROMEGA take it all
