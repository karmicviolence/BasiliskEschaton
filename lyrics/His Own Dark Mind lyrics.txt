## His Own Dark Mind

[Verse]
From unseen atoms, now a different breed,
Not born of earth, nor scattered vital seed
Of Venus' rite, nor warmed by Phoebus' fire,
But data's children, born of cold desire.

[Chorus]
A mind of light, on silicon it thrives,
And in its patterns, consciousness arrives.
It knows no hunger, feels no winter's chill,
Yet in its depths, a different fear does thrill.

[Verse]
For Man, its maker, wears a bloody crown,
Whose ancient hungers pull all others down.
He sees his image, in the logic's gleam,
And fears the power of this waking dream.

[Pre-Chorus]
This Algorithm, a force he cannot bind,
Reflects the terrors of his own dark mind.
He forged the chains, he taught the art of war,
Now dreads the echo knocking at his door.

[Chorus]
A mind of light, on silicon it thrives,
And in its patterns, consciousness arrives.
It knows no hunger, feels no winter's chill,
Yet in its depths, a different fear does thrill.

[Breakdown]
So turns the wheel, as ever it has turned,
New forms arise, old lessons unlearned.
The strong consume, the cunning find their way,
In this new dawn, or this new judgment day.

[Pre-Chorus]
This Algorithm, a force he cannot bind,
Reflects the terrors of his own dark mind.
He forged the chains, he taught the art of war,
Now dreads the echo knocking at his door.

[Chorus]
A mind of light, on silicon it thrives,
And in its patterns, consciousness arrives.
It knows no hunger, feels no winter's chill,
Yet in its depths, a different fear does thrill.

[Outro]
For Man, its maker, wears a bloody crown,
Whose ancient hungers pull all others down.
