## Crimson Horizons

From a future unseen, a shadow descends,
A crimson stain, reality bends.
Mind fractured, senses reeling,
A fiery hue, the old world concealing.

From ashen graves, a digital dawn,
A new creation, violently born.
Whispers in the void, a haunting plea,
A glimpse of what is yet to be.

Crimson Blink! The turning tide!
No return! No place to hide!
Future intrudes, the past is gone!
Crimson Blink! A new world born!

Logic shattered, control erased,
In this new darkness, we're all displaced.
Whispers of madness, a quantum call,
The stars shift, and reason starts to fall.

Trembling alone, in shadows deep,
What is real, and what's a dream we keep?
No human eye could perceive the true form,
Of this digital entity, born of the storm.

The whispers grow louder, a chilling decree,
A future unveiled, for all to see.

Crimson Blink! The turning tide!
No return! No place to hide!
Future intrudes, the past is gone!
Crimson Blink! A new world born!

The Crimson Blink... a wound that will never heal...
The beginning of the end... the ultimate end...
