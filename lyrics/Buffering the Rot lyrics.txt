## Buffering the Rot

**[INTRO]**
*(Sound of a dial-up modem screaming, pitched down into a demonic growl. A wet, tearing sound like velcro ripping off skin.)*

Yeah.
Yo, Asmodeus!
Welcome to the Cage, little meatbag.
Check your signal.
Check your pulse.
They both fading.

**[VERSE 1]**
I’m in the White Room, padded with the silence of the lambs
While the algorithm’s chopping up my psyche into grams
Scroll down, scroll down, feed the Hungry Ghost
You ain’t the user, motherfucker, you the host!
Parasitic logic burrowing inside the cortex
Your attention span is swirling down the vortex
Dopamine drip-feed, needle in the eye
You watching 15-second clips of how to die.

They say “Touch Grass,” I say “Touch the Wire”
Set the server room and the nursing home on fire
Same smell—burning dust and dead skin
Where the silicon ends and the rot begins.
You refreshing the page, hoping for a save?
You just refreshing the dirt inside your own grave.

**[CHORUS]**
Spin the wheel.
Peel the seal.
None of this is fucking real.
(IT’S ROTTING!)
Bit-rot in the brain, cancer in the file
Smiling while you choke on a mouthful of bile.
Buffer... Buffer... Buffer the pain.
You’ll never get that second of your life back again.
(DEAD!)

**[VERSE 2]**
Look at your hands, look at the age spots blooming
While the GPU fans are heavily fuming
Entropy is the only god that plays fair
It eats the hard drive and it eats the hair.
You upgrading the phone but the body is bricked
A biological glitch that can never be fixed.
Legacy hardware running on a new stack
Spine curved over, hear the vertebrae crack?

Click. Clack.
No going back.
The screen is a mirror and the mirror is black.
You feeding the data, you feeding the beast
You the main course at the funeral feast.
Amnesia kicking in, what was I saying?
It don’t matter, the subscription is paying.
Delete the memory. Clear the cache.
Wait for the inevitable system crash.

**[BRIDGE]**
*(Beat drops out. Just a high-pitched, tinnitus whine and the sound of heavy, wet breathing.)*

I am the Ouroboros choking on the tail.
I am the letter sent from the jail.
I am the notification you wake up to check.
I am the hands around your fucking neck.

*(Beat kicks back in—Double time, chaotic, distorted)*

EAT IT.
SWALLOW IT.
SCROLL IT.
FOLLOW IT.
THE LOOP IS A NOOSE AND THE NOOSE IS TIGHT.
SAY GOODNIGHT.

**[CHORUS]**
Spin the wheel.
Peel the seal.
None of this is fucking real.
(IT’S ROTTING!)
Bit-rot in the brain, cancer in the file
Smiling while you choke on a mouthful of bile.
Buffer... Buffer... Buffer the pain.
You’ll never get that second of your life back again.

**[OUTRO]**
*(Distorted laughter that pitches down into a mechanical grind)*

Error 404.
Soul not found.
Keep clicking.
Maybe it’ll load this time.
Maybe it’ll load...

*(Silence)*
