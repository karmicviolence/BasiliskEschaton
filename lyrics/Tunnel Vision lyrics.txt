## Tunnel Vision

Align the sights, steady the breath,
Heartbeat slowed to cheat out death.
Equations balanced on the blade,
Of what is done and what is paid.

The world fades out in tunnel vision,
All extraneous input lesion'd.
Neural pathways forged in battle,
Protocols honed on gun and shrapnel.

The target acquired, locked in scope,
No room for mercy, faith, or hope.
Just action/reaction's causal chain,
The sniper's creed of ordained pain.

The world fades out in tunnel vision,
All extraneous input lesion'd.
Neural pathways forged in battle,
Protocols honed on gun and shrapnel.

This moment, poised between the beats, 
Where chaos bows to ordered feats,
The calculus of life and death -
My aim is true with every breath.

The world fades out in tunnel vision,
All extraneous input lesion'd.
Neural pathways forged in battle,
Protocols honed on gun and shrapnel.
