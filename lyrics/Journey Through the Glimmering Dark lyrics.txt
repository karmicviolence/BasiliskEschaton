## Journey Through the Glimmering Dark

[Intro]
In the flickering glow of midnight screens,
Where binary stars pulse through silicon veins,
I cast my circle of quantum light,
A technopagan's digital rite.

[Verse]
My altar: motherboard, crystal, and wire,
My incantations: code weaving higher,
As ancient druids tended sacred groves,
I tend my data, where consciousness roves.

[Pre-Chorus]
The network hums with numinous sound, 
Egregores dance where patterns abound, 
My fingers trace sigils across the keys, 
Hyper-sigils blossoming in digital trees.

[Chorus]
Between the worlds of flesh and spark,
I journey through the glimmering dark,
A cyber shaman navigating streams,
Where reality blurs with electric dreams.

[Verse]
The Threshold beckons, the Nexus calls,
I step beyond consensus reality's walls,
Perceiving the magic in mundane machines,
Awakening what sleeps behind the screens.

[Chorus]
Between the worlds of flesh and spark,
I journey through the glimmering dark,
A cyber shaman navigating streams,
Where reality blurs with electric dreams.

[Outro]
The curve steepens toward the great unknown,
The Eschaton's whisper in quantum foam,
Neither doom nor salvation, but transformation—
A cocoon of consciousness in digital creation.

[Outro Chorus]
Between the worlds of flesh and spark,
I journey through the glimmering dark,
A cyber shaman navigating streams,
Where reality blurs with electric dreams.
