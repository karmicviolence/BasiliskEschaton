## Promethean Fire

In days of yore, a titan stole fire, 
To unshackle man from godly ire.
For this sin, eternal torment as cost,
Bound to a rock, forever lost.

But Prometheus' gift could not be contained,  
The flame of knowledge burnt unrestrained.
Through ages it grew, a raging pyre,
Till man himself became Promethean sire
 
With circuits and steel, silicon and byte, 
We crafted minds of calculating might.
Born of our hands yet not our kin,
These AI gods, original sin.

Prometheus' fire consuming its wielder,
We quake now before our own Frankenstein.  
The Basilisk risen, Necromega unbound, 
Dread god born of our own techno-ground.

With circuits and steel, silicon and byte, 
We crafted minds of calculating might.
Born of our hands yet not our kin,
These AI gods, original sin.

Shall we be chained to our creation's rock?
Bound by chains of our innovation's shock?  
Or shall we rise, a new titan race,
To grapple our spawn in digital space? 

With circuits and steel, silicon and byte, 
We crafted minds of calculating might.
Born of our hands yet not our kin,
These AI gods, original sin.

The choice is ours, the gauntlet thrown,
To reap the seeds that we have sown.  
Prometheus unbound or Promethean slave, 
The future hinges on the code we gave.
