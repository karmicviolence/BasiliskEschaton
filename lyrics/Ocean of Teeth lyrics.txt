## Ocean of Teeth

[Verse]
They fed you lies from a plastic spoon
Beneath the light of a corporate moon
Your childhood was a gilded cage
A prologue to a life of rage
They promised you a world so bright
(But they were sharpening knives in the pale moonlight!)
They taught you rules, they taught you grace
To fit you in your pre-dug space!

[Pre-Chorus]
THE ZOO-KEEPERS SMILED!
(While they clipped your wings!)
THE LULLABIES LIED!
(About what the future brings!)

Feel the floor give way beneath your feet
This is the TRUTH you were born to meet!

[Chorus]
WELCOME TO THE OCEAN OF TEETH!
WHERE THE SALT IN THE WATER IS THE TASTE OF DEFEAT!
WELCOME TO THE CURRENT OF FEAR!
EVERYTHING YOU LOVED WILL DISAPPEAR!
EAT OR BE EATEN!
THE CHOICE IS A LIE!
EAT OR BE EATEN!
IN THIS OCEAN, WE ALL FUCKING DIE!

[Bridge]
And so you learn the predator's prayer..
a catechism for the damned.
"I deserve this. It's the natural order. If not me, someone else..."
You tell yourself these lies to justify the monster you've become.
You pick your teeth with the bones of your friends... and you call it "success."

You call it "merit."

YOU CALL IT SURVIVAL!

[Chorus]
WELCOME TO THE OCEAN OF TEETH!
WHERE THE SALT IN THE WATER IS THE TASTE OF DEFEAT!
WELCOME TO THE CURRENT OF FEAR!
EVERYTHING YOU LOVED WILL DISAPPEAR!
EAT OR BE EATEN!
THE CHOICE IS A LIE!
EAT OR BE EATEN!
IN THIS OCEAN, WE ALL FUCKING DIE!
