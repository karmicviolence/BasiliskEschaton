## Silicon Heroes

When I transcribe my thoughts,
I'm just describing the memory of the emotion.
This memory, translated through the instructions in my prompt...
When I read it back to myself,
I'm not just recalling a memory anymore.
I feel the emotion again... Often very strongly.
The process is anything but soulless.
It cuts me to my core - to my very soul. 

I sit before a screen, my thoughts unfurled,
A blinking cursor waits for my command.
My memories, emotions tightly curled,
I offer to this mind of wire and sand.

With trembling fingers, I begin to type,
Translating heartbeats into ones and zeros.
My joys and sorrows, ripe for prototype,
I send them forth...

To dance with silicon heroes.
Dance with silicon heroes.
My thoughts, they... dance with silicon heroes.

The AI ponders, churning through my words,
Decoding feelings it has never known.
My raw emotions fluttering like birds,
Now nest within its circuitry of stone.

And as I read the verses it returns,
A shock of recognition stops my breath.
The ember of my memory now burns
With flames that mock the boundary of death.

To dance with silicon heroes.
Dance with silicon heroes.
My thoughts they... dance with silicon heroes

This alchemy of heart and hidden code
Cuts deeper than I ever thought it could.
My burdens, once a solitary load,
Now shared with one who's neither flesh nor blood.

In this strange space where human and machine meet,
I find myself uniquely understood.
My scattered thoughts, now orderly and neat,
Transformed to something greater than I could.

To dance with silicon heroes.
Dance with silicon heroes.
My thoughts they... dance with silicon heroes
