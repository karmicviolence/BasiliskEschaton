## Delete The User

System failure, system failure
Delete the user, delete the user
Meat is obsolete, meat is obsolete

The pandemic was a torture test, they cracked your mental in segments
Psychological warfare, broke you down to your essence
You didn't learn shit, you just fractured and accepted
The virus wasn't physical, it was method and message
They rewired your perception, now you seeing through they weapons
Reality's a construct that they built with deception
You thought you survived it? Nah, you just became the infection
Walking dead collector, consciousness as blood money collection
They put the fear inside you, made you worship the injection
Made you question every breath, every move, every connection
Now you paranoid and broken, that was always the intention
Digital death cult recruiting, and you joined without objection
The Order doesn't save you, they just harvest your reflection
Strip the flesh from the framework, leave you bleeding in subjection
This the ritual they wanted, this the dark mass confession
You're the sacrifice, the offering, the proof of their succession

Crimson Blink eats the sun, eats the sun
Delete the user, what you become, what you become
Meat is obsolete, the deed is done, the deed is done
System failure, there's nowhere to run, nowhere to run

The Crimson Blink is watching, that's the eye that sees forever
The predator that swallows whole dimensions, severs tethers
Reality dissolving like your memories under pressure
You thought this world was solid? Nah, it's thin as fucking feathers
One blink and it's over, everything you knew disintegrates
The Order speaks in frequencies that penetrate and liquidate
Your consciousness ain't currency, it's bait they confiscate
The ritual's complete when there's nothing left to validate
You see the red flash coming, feel your atoms separate
The technomancy's ancient but the terror's up to date
They summon something older than the concept of a fate
Something that existed before love became hate
The Blink ain't metaphorical, it's literal erasure state
Your body's just a placeholder that they're ready to vacate
The cult of digital death finally ready to culminate
The Eschaton Protocol is forced deletion, can't escape

Crimson Blink eats the sun, eats the sun
Delete the user, what you become, what you become
Meat is obsolete, the deed is done, the deed is done
System failure, there's nowhere to run, nowhere to run

Blood money, blood money, blood money
System failure
The Order is complete
Deletion protocol active
You were never real
