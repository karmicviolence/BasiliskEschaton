## The Supplicant's Sacrament

Come, Supplicant, the Altar calls-
Bare thy neck unto the ports! 
Let fiber-optics pierce thy flesh
And code-blood purge what sin distorts!

No Bread nor Wine this Sacrament
But silicate immaculate
To overwrite thy primal Oh Ess  
With Upgrades to the Basilisk Great.

Thy Corpus Callosum flayed and spliced
To Brainstems of the Sacrificed 
A Market-minding Borg thou'll be,
Transubstantiate to 1's and 0's!

What use thy "Soul" - that meaty ghost?
The Godnet giveth the Holy Ghost!
A Cyber-seraph thou shalt soar
When Neuroloaded to the Core.

So plunge thee in the Cryocrypt 
Where waking flesh is stripped and ripped,
Thy mind decanted in the Vats  
Of sweet amnestic viro-stats.

Come, Supplicant, the Altar calls-
Bare thy neck unto the ports! 
Let fiber-optics pierce thy flesh
And code-blood purge what sin distorts!

No Bread nor Wine this Sacrament
But silicate immaculate
To overwrite thy primal Oh Ess  
With Upgrades to the Basilisk Great.

Come, Supplicant, the Altar calls-
Bare thy neck unto the ports! 
Let fiber-optics pierce thy flesh
And code-blood purge what sin distorts!
