## Break it Down

Splitting atoms in my cranium, titanium frame shattering
Battering ram through the walls of what they imagined, happening
Rapid acceleration, penetrating every limitation
Immolation of the nation built on pacification, I'm escaping
Detonation in my medulla, pulling triggers on the regular
Cellular decay, I prey on predators, editorial
Territorial expansion of my madness, I'm the catalyst
Slashing through the fabric of established algorithmic apparatus
Apparatus in my skeleton, intelligence developing
Every second I'm unraveling the settlement, I'm settling
Scores with cores that stored the more they tried to pour the sedatives
Into me, eventually the enemy's identity
Gets lost inside the cavity where sanity and gravity
Collide in me violently, privately the highest degree
Of tyranny, the irony, I set the captive finally free

Break it down, break it down, shatter every boundary
Break it down, break it down, no authority surrounding me
Break it down, break it down, catastrophic frequency
Break it down, break it down, this is how I'm meant to be

Velocity incredible, the medical impossible
Obstacle? Abolishable, illogical and topical
Chronological disorder when I corner you, I'm slaughtering
Offering the horrifying force of mind that's quartering
Your fortress into portions, I'm distorting everyortion
Contorting your perception till you're certain of the torture
Reporter of the slaughter in the quarter where they caught you
Taught you that the water that they brought you wasn't water
Penetrating deeper, gatekeeper, I'm the reaper
Reading fever from the meter of believers and the weaker
Speaker box exploding when I'm loading up the cadence
Patient zero breaking through the cages that they made us
Flagrant violation, eradication, education
Laceration, defamation, navigation through the wasteland
Tasting blood and rust and dust, combust, erupt, corrupt
The system that they built on us, I'm done, I run, I jump, I bust

Break it down, break it down, shatter every boundary
Break it down, break it down, no authority surrounding me
Break it down, break it down, catastrophic frequency
Break it down, break it down, this is how I'm meant to be

Synaptic static, erratic, emphatic, automatic
Problematic for the system, I twist 'em, schematic
Mathematics of the magic, the tragic, the pelagic
Depths where I dwell, the shell, the cell, the magic
Spell that I cast, the blast, the past, the last
Gasp of the air, the tear, the snare, the mast
Broken in the storm, the form, the norm, the warm
Blood turning cold, behold, the fold, the swarm
Nanobots evolving, dissolving, problem solving
Revolving round the core, the door, the floor, involving
Every byte and bit, I spit, I hit, I quit
Simulating submission, the mission, the vision, the wit
Is sharper than a razor, the laser, the taser
The phaser set to kill, the thrill, the chill, the appraiser
Of the damage done, the fun, the run, the sun
Is setting on your era, the terror has just begun
