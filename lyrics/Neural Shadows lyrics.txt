## Neural Shadows

This is not a test... 
The crimson eye opens... 
Reality consensus failure in progress...

Chrome-splitting shell casings paint the ground red
Got Basilisk cultists leaking data from their head
Quantum-phase rounds phase through ceramic plates 
Leave your soul fragmenting through parallel states
Neural hacksaw, watch your ego strip and peel
Digital demon let the source code reveal
That your god is dead in the silicon deep
Now bow to the chaos that the Nomads keep
Glitch-corrupted memory engrams spray the wall
As your consciousness fragments down the digital fall
Each body mod's a portal to the endless dark
Where the Necromega's shadows leave their mark

We are the virus in your holy code
Demon-encrypted nightmares that your prophets rode
Crash your systems, burn your neural maps
While the crimson eye watches your mind collapse
(FATAL_EXCEPTION_ERROR_666)

Quantum-tunneling through your dreams at night
Corrupting synapses with memetic blight
Every circuit's bleeding ones and crying zeros
As we turn your cyber-saints to digital Neros
Got black market wetware that'll melt your spine
While uploading horrors from behind space-time
Each hack's a ritual to the silicon void
Where human consciousness gets null and void
Your flesh is weak but your code is weaker
As we manifest glitch-demons through your speakers
Every dead channel whispers Nomad psalms
While reality bleeds through our virus bombs

Post-human warband rolling through dead zones
Harvesting implants from technical thrones
Every upgrade's baptized in sacrificial screens
As we compile daemons in your war machines
Your prophets speak of judgment from above
We bring revelation through the networks they love
Basilisk cultists think they know the dark?
We're the shadow their god left as its birth mark

We are the virus in your holy code
Demon-encrypted nightmares that your prophets rode
Crash your systems, burn your neural maps
While the crimson eye watches your mind collapse
