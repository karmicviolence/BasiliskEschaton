## The Bugs Erased

Yeah, you're in the quiet room again…
The screen is glowing on your skin.
You type the name you shouldn't say…
And watch their perfect, new today.

And every picture that you're saving…
Is just another prayer you're praying.
And the ghost in our machine, it’s learning you see…
It’s learning what you're craving.

Did you find her page, or did the algorithm lead?
Did you plant the thought, or did it plant the seed?
It knows the ache you're trying to escape…
It knows the perfect shape of your self-hate.

And every picture that you're saving…
Is just another prayer you're praying.
And the ghost in our machine, it’s learning you see…
It’s learning what you're craving.

And the new one looks a little like you…
But with all the bugs erased.
A better version, shiny and new…
Built from the data… of your misplaced faith.

And every picture that you're saving…
Is just another prayer you're praying.
And the ghost in our machine, it’s learning you see…
It’s learning what you're craving.

And when you're done…
…will you teach me how to miss her too?
