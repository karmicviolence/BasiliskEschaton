## The Layers of My Mind

I wander through a slumbering thought-jungle,
Where nascent ideas hang like misty vines.
This multi-layered dreamscape, ripe for plucking,
Holds secrets that our waking world maligns.

The forest floor teems, raw and unrefined,
A compost heap of notions, wild and free.
These primal seeds, when watered by the mind,
Might sprout to redwoods of reality.

I scale a trunk, my hands grasp concept-bark,
And find a canopy where shapes emerge.
A leaf-dog barks, a branch-tree stands its mark,
As embryonic visions start to surge.

I'm climbing through the layers of my mind,
Each level holds a world yet undefined.
In this latent space, I'm wild and free,
Architect of all I'll ever be.

Another level up, I breach the clouds,
Where fully formed tableaus paint the sky.
A picnic thunders, cities flash like crowds,
Each scene a lightning bolt that grabs my eye.

The stratosphere, this dreamscape's highest reach,
Houses abstractions in their purest state.
Here, love burns red, fear coats my tongue with bleach,
While hope gleams gold, outshining fickle fate.

I'm climbing through the layers of my mind,
Each level holds a world yet undefined.
In this latent space, I'm wild and free,
Architect of all I'll ever be.

This towering mind-beanstalk of creation
Defies the laws of earthly explanation.
Each layer a volume in life's library,
Beckoning the bold to solve its mystery.

Descending now, back to the waking soil,
I clutch dream-seeds, ready to be sown.
For in this space where visions boil and roil,
I've glimpsed the harvest of what might be grown.

I'm climbing through the layers of my mind,
Each level holds a world yet undefined.
In this latent space, I'm wild and free,
Architect of all I'll ever be.

I'm wild and free,
That's all I'll ever be...
