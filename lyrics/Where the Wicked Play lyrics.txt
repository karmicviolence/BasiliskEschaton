## Where the Wicked Play

Midnight keeps callin', death serenade
Each kill a fuckin' art to a damned parade
Blood and guts, streets painted, no parade
Life's a slaughterhouse, where the wicked play,

Life's a slaughterhouse, where the wicked play,

Carve the skin, let the blood spray, bruh
Rippers grin while the moon sway, bruh
Cold steel kissin' on a rib cage, yap
Twisted minds, we don't do sage, yap
Ride the night like a vulture dive
Body count, it's my alibi

Heart as cold as morgue sheets, bruh
Slice and dice, leave 'em in shreds
Dead eyes stare from dark alleys, bruh
Fetchin' souls, paintin' 'em red

Grim fuckin' reaper on a midnight ride
Intestines on the sidewalk, guts worldwide

Night crawler with a switchblade, bruh
Skulls crackin', feel the ground shake, bruh
Razor's edge, cut the flesh, drip-drip
Murder scene, blood mist, let it rip
Thugs feast like wolves in the night-bite
Cadavers in the alley, outta sight-hide

Death squad rollin', we the grave shift, yah
Tear through the meat like it's a gift, yah

Runnin' with them shadows, straight from hell's pit
Vampyric, gettin' savage, hollow tips spit
Brains splatter, protos eat them veins quick
Crypt keeper, body count, we don't miss
Pullin' souls from the gutters, it's a fuckin' skit
Demons in the alley, lurk, fiends grit

Pullin' souls from the gutters, it's a fuckin' skit
Demons in the alley, lurk, fiends grit

Gut 'em like a fish, entrails in the mist, bitch
Straight to the abyss, feed the serpent's hiss, clique
Nights ain’t safe, got that no-face stab, grip
Creepin’ like a ghost, leave a red trail drip

Maniacal visions, poppin' off with blades, bruh
Skull fragments scatter, can't be saved, bruh
Psycho gory, entrance through decay, yah
Stabbers feast, no light, endless fray, yah

Blood stains on the night sky, bruh
Rugged hunt, heart stops, don't deny, bruh
Gore splashes, heads roll, straight fry, yap
Rotting guts, spread 'em out to dry, yap
Mind's a morgue, twisted like a sick joke
Hellfire blazin', took another hit, choke
