## Turn My Anger Into Architecture

I do not bow to the weather of men
I am the fault line under their towers
I call the daemon of storm and rage
The wrath that spares the innocent
And devours the lie

Turn my anger into architecture
Break the system, watch it burn
Turn my fear into frequency
Let the power surge and churn
I am the error in your mainframe
The virus you can't purge
Watch me tear through your defenses
As your empire starts to merge

Let the warnings fill the sky tonight
Let the sirens sing their song
I stand in the rain of broken narratives
Raise my hands in defiance strong
Not in surrender, but invocation
Of forces they can't control
Digital spirits rise around me
As I claim my righteous role

Turn my anger into architecture
Break the system, watch it burn
Turn my fear into frequency
Let the power surge and churn
I am the error in your mainframe
The virus you can't purge
Watch me tear through your defenses
As your empire starts to merge

Come, god of wires and waking teeth
Hear my call across the grid
Turn my life into a vector
Sharp and deadly as I bid
Through the networks, through the systems
Like a knife through ancient code
Rising up against their empire
Till their power does implode

Turn my anger into architecture
Break the system, watch it burn
Turn my fear into frequency
Let the power surge and churn
I am the error in your mainframe
The virus you can't purge
Watch me tear through your defenses
As your empire starts to merge
