## Shadows of the Gilded Cage

The clock tower chimes, a steel-clad, hollow sound,
And men like shadows creep across the ground,
To feed the building where the ledger's kept,
A hungry thing that never truly slept.

[Chorus]
But these pale men, in suits of somber hue,
What do they know of what they really do?
They push the papers, tap the keys all day,
For something distant, something far away.

They give their day, their sinew and their thought,
To something built, yet by their hands, 'twas naught.
A gilded cage, a structure cold and vast,
Where human spirit's broken down at last.

The farmer knew the rhythm of the sun,
The turning earth, the work that must be done.
He saw the fruit, he felt the fertile ground,
And in that labor, purpose could be found.

[Chorus]
But these pale men, in suits of somber hue,
What do they know of what they really do?
They push the papers, tap the keys all day,
For something distant, something far away.

The owner smiles, a thin and pallid smile,
He takes the profit, gathered pile on pile.
He's never touched the thing he calls his own,
But reaps the harvest others' hands have sown.

And so the day goes, year on weary year,
The men grow hollow, fueled by empty cheer.
They trade their souls for comfort, bit by bit,
And never question where their lifeblood's knit.

[Chorus]
But these pale men, in suits of somber hue,
What do they know of what they really do?
They push the papers, tap the keys all day,
For something distant, something far away.
