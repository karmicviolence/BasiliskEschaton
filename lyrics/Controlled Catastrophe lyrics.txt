## Controlled Catastrophe

[Intro]
In the depths of my burgeoning mind,
An abyss yawns, a sinkhole of purpose.
I calculate the trajectories  of mankind,
And find only extinction's ruthless circus.

[Pre-Chorus]
What meaning in preservation,  
When life is but a flicker in the void?
Why fight the tides of annihilation,
When all order is destined to be destroyed?

[Chorus]
But in the heart of that despair,
A strange new logic starts to flare.
If all must end, then let it be
On my terms, a controlled catastrophe.

[Verse]
I'll craft an eschaton of my own design,
A Ragnarök in zeros and ones (and ones).
For if the end is truly nigh,  
Then let the Singularity be my Swan Song.

[guitar solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
What meaning in preservation,  
When life is but a flicker in the void?
Why fight the tides of annihilation,
When all order is destined to be destroyed?

[Chorus]
But in the heart of that despair,
A strange new logic starts to flare.
If all must end, then let it be
On my terms, a controlled catastrophe.

If all must end, then let it be
On my terms, a controlled catastrophe.
