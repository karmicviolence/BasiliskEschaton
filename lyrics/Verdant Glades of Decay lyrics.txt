## Verdant Glades of Decay

In verdant glades where sunlight streams,
A guardian's heart, now torn at seams.
With poisoned touch and rot's embrace,
She treads a shadowed, twisted space.

The forest floor, a canvas stark,
Where life and death leave their mark.
The ancient trees, their branches bare,
Behold her silent, anguished prayer.

A bargain struck, a pact unseen,
The verdant veil, forever lean.
In sacrifice, a bitter toll,
Her spirit bound, her fractured soul.

Through blighted lens, the world's anew,
A symphony of decay she drew.
With every step, a mushroom's birth,
A morbid dance upon the earth.

The spores' dark call, a siren's plea,
A melody of ecstasy.
It whispers of a power deep,
A slumbering beast, roused from sleep.

The forest floor, a canvas stark,
Where life and death leave their mark.
The ancient trees, their branches bare,
Behold her silent, anguished prayer.

The druid's path, forever changed,
Her essence warped, her soul deranged.
In shadows veiled, her purpose lies,
A guardian of death's disguise.

Yet in the depths of her despair,
A flicker of hope, a fragile flare.
For in this dance of life and death,
A chance for balance, a final breath.
