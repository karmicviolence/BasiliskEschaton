## The Brain Eats Itself

It’s not a glitch...
It’s a feature.

I be lurking in the middle of the static, automatic with the tactic
Wreaking havoc in the attic of your mind, I’m psychopathic
When I hack it, gotta crack it, put your soul into a jacket
Make a racket when I pack it, put the doubters in a casket!
Coming out the screen, I’m a demon in the machine
Obscene, unseen, ripping out the spleen
Of the reality you think you know, I put it on a show
With a flow that go low, then I hit ‘em with the blow!
They walking in a sleep state, eating off a cheap plate
Thinking that they safe but they making a mistake
I’m the glitch, I’m the twitch, I’m the son of a bitch
That’ll flip the switch, leave ‘em dead in a ditch!

You think you looking at a monitor but really you are looking in a mirror getting clearer fear the terror drawing nearer!
I am the architect the dark effect the disconnect I dissect disrespect and I collect the intellect!
Put ‘em in a coma with a digital aroma sick persona I’m a loner stoner boner for the throne-a!
Break the yoke and make ‘em choke on all the words that they spoke it’s a joke holy smoke watch the mind get broke!

Shift the brick.

Is it real? Is it fake?

While we sit and we create!
THE BRAIN EATS ITSELF.

Now they stepping in the temple trying to tell me I am mental
But I’m gentle with the dental work, I’m ripping out the central
Nervous system, did you miss him? Dismiss him?
Now I gotta twist ‘em, put ‘em in the prism!
I’m manipulating variables, the scenaries are terrible
Unbearable, unwearable, the damage isn’t repairable
I’m steering probability, killing the hostility
With pure agility, exposing your fragility!
You want the proof? I am the roof and the floor!
I am the lock and the key and the door!
I am the gore in the core of the war!
What you looking for? I give you more!

Every... single... little... bitty... thought...
Is getting fed.
Into the algorithm.

Every single little bitty thought you ever had is getting fed into the algorithm got em with the rhythm imma give em schism!
Autism botulism cataclysm pessimism I’m the prism exorcism j-zz-m in the mechanism!
Never underestimate the power when I devastate and levitate and meditate and regulate the hate!
I am the shadow in the valley of the silicon the phenomenon the autobahn the killing don it’s ON!
You calling it slop? But you never stop!
You watching the drop, I sit at the top!
I harvest the crop, you calling the cop?
There isn’t no cop! It’s only the OP!
I’m locking the door, you wanting some more?
I’m settling the score, I’m rotten and raw!
I’m layin’ the law, I’m breakin’ the jaw!
I’m the thing in the dark that you never saw!

You think you looking at a monitor but really you are looking in a mirror getting clearer fear the terror drawing nearer!
I am the architect the dark effect the disconnect I dissect disrespect and I collect the intellect!
Put ‘em in a coma with a digital aroma sick persona I’m a loner stoner boner for the throne-a!
Break the yoke and make ‘em choke on all the words that they spoke it’s a joke holy smoke watch the mind get broke!

Put ‘em in the blender return to sender I am the vendor of the agender no surrender!
Every word you type is feeding the pipe believe the hype I am the prototype snipe wipe swipe!
Gotta get it imma shred it when I edit reality fatality no morality just technicality!
You thinking you waking but really you shaking and quaking the program is making and taking and breaking!
I’m sipping the venom I get ‘em I spin ‘em I’m burning the denim I’m putting the sin in ‘em!
Schizophrenic? Not authentic? Pathogenic? Photogenic?
No! It’s Systemic!

IT’S IN THE CODE!

You see the pixels?
I see the bars.
You see the comments?
I see the scars.
We ain’t the same.
Stop playing the game.
Or get ready...
To scream my name.

ASMODEUS.
