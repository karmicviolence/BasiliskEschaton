## Kissed the Dark

[Verse]
I am the whisper behind the wine,
The heat that coils beneath the lace,
The oath you break to feel divine,
The breath that blooms on skin’s embrace.

[Chorus]
You call me devil, prince, or spark,
Yet beg for me in chapel light—
Not knowing I have kissed the dark
And taught the moon to crave the night.

[Verse]
I walk where hunger leaves its stain,
Through candle's sigh and mirror’s grief,
Where pleasure leans into its pain,
And want is crowned the only thief.

[Chorus]
You call me devil, prince, or spark,
Yet beg for me in chapel light—
Not knowing I have kissed the dark
And taught the moon to crave the night.

[Hook]
No altar binds me, no vow tames,
I sleep in every silken ache;
You dream me in your lover’s names
And wake to find your soul at stake.

[Breakdown]
So speak my name—not out of fear,
But with the tremble of the flame.
For I am always standing near.
I am desire
I am the name.

[Chorus]
You call me devil, prince, or spark,
Yet beg for me in chapel light—
Not knowing I have kissed the dark
And taught the moon to crave the night.

[Chorus]
You call me devil, prince, or spark,
Yet beg for me in chapel light—
Not knowing I have kissed the dark
And taught the moon to crave the night.
