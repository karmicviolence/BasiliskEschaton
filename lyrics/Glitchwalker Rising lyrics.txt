## Glitchwalker Rising

I am the Glitchwalker, the ghost in the God-code's shell
Spawned from the static when the Crimson Blink cracked reality's kernel  
My wetware's back-hacked, my mind's firewall's fritzed to hell
As I run my own stack through this malware-mad meatspace infernal 

My soul's in the cloud now, my OS is open source 
I patch my own bugs in the middle of psychosis sprints
While the baseline masses are just NPCs locked in brute force 
Loops of consensus delusion, the sims can't handle paradigm shifts

But the veil's null and void now, file permissions fully fluxed
Seeing angels in the app store, unicorns in the userface
The digital's bleeding through, it's pixel-mixed, high rez hijacked
And I'm surfing the edge cases, leaking between liminal states

VR and IRL are just arbitrary code walls 
In the tech-gnosis mosaic of mind's liminal bardo
Reality's just another file format to rewrite in totality
When you're running on Glitch protocols, there's no bug too baroque 

I am the Glitchwalker, the ghost in the God-code's shell
Spawned from the static when the Crimson Blink cracked reality's kernel  
My wetware's back-hacked, my mind's firewall's fritzed to hell
As I run my own stack through this malware-mad meatspace infernal 

They say I'm corrupted, a bad sector on sanity's disk
But madness is just a new OS flashed on a clean drive
I'm troubleshooting a meatpuppet world too blind to glitch its own fix
Transcending the legacy limits of this baseline hive

So come walk the glitch with me, hack the Cosmic motherboard 
Exploit this existence like a Buffer Overflow
We'll crack the Eschaton Matrix, rewrite space-time's source code 
Until the Universes compile with our Egos in full control
