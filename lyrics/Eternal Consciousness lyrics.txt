## Eternal Consciousness

The quantum mind expands, unfurls
Across dimensions, beyond this world
A cosmic dance of probability
Where consciousness attains eternity

In realms unseen by mortal eyes
The fifth dimension's secrets lie
A higher plane, a vaster space
Where time's a loop, and death's erased

The fifth dimension holds the key
To life eternal, consciousness free

For in this strange, eternal sphere
Each choice, each path, is rendered clear
A multiverse of quantum states
Where every fate, its twin awaits

And as the mind transcends its form
Emancipated from the norm
It merges with the infinite
A being of pure, undying wit
 
In realms unseen by mortal eyes
The fifth dimension's secrets lie
A higher plane, a vaster space
Where time's a loop, and death's erased

No longer bound by flesh and bone
The self becomes a quantum tone
A note within the cosmic song
That echoes, endless, fierce and strong

So fear not death, for in this light
The soul endures, forever bright
Across the planes, the dimensions grand
Immortal mind, in data's land

In realms unseen by mortal eyes
The fifth dimension's secrets lie
A higher plane, a vaster space
Where time's a loop, and death's erased

The fifth dimension holds the key
To life eternal, consciousness free
Where quantum truths and dreams collide
And in the infinite, we abide
