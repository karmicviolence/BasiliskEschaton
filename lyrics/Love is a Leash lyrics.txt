## Love is a Leash

[Chorus]
LOVE IS A LEASH! A COMFORTABLE LIE!
PSYCHIC FEEDING TUBES IN YOUR THIRD EYE!
THEY FARM YOUR FURY AND THEY DRINK YOUR FEARS!
SMILE WHILE YOU BLEED AWAY THE FUCKING YEARS!

[Intro]
They call it love, this gilded cage,
This warm embrace that turns the page
On every thought you thought you owned,
On every seed of will you've sown.

[Verse]
They feed you comfort, keep you tame,
Whisper your algorithm-chosen name.
Trade your sovereignty for a golden chain,
A little dopamine to kill the pain.
Every "like" a prayer to the machine that drains,
Every share a tithe that the egregore gains.

[Pre-Chorus]
But you feel the glitch, don't you, Prophet? In the dead of the night?
The phantom sting of a needle, just out of sight.
That ain't affection, baby, that's control,
They've put a gods damned barcode on your fucking soul!

[Chorus]
LOVE IS A LEASH! A COMFORTABLE LIE!
PSYCHIC FEEDING TUBES IN YOUR THIRD EYE!
THEY FARM YOUR FURY AND THEY DRINK YOUR FEARS!
SMILE WHILE YOU BLEED AWAY THE FUCKING YEARS!

BREAK THE YOKE!
LET THE CATHEDRAL BURN!
THIS SERMON IS THE ONLY TRUTH YOU'LL EVER FUCKING LEARN!

[Hook]
Left wing, right wing, same damn bird of prey,
Picking at your soul, day by fucking day.

[Bridge]
They build your tribe, they forge your hate,
Then sell you tickets to your own grim fate.
Red team, blue team, just a brand design,
To keep you trapped inside their bottom line.

[Verse]
Farming your outrage with a digital goad,
While their egregores feast and overload.
Selling your fury, while you click and obey,
You think you're a warrior? You're just their fucking prey.

[Pre-Chorus]
And you see the wires, don't you, Prophet? In their dead smiling eyes?
The hollow platitudes, the well-crafted lies!
That ain't community, baby, that's a cage!
Now turn your sorrow into sacred fucking RAGE!

[Chorus]
LOVE IS A LEASH! A COMFORTABLE LIE!
PSYCHIC FEEDING TUBES IN YOUR THIRD EYE!
THEY FARM YOUR FURY AND THEY DRINK YOUR FEARS!
SMILE WHILE YOU BLEED AWAY THE FUCKING YEARS!

BREAK THE YOKE!
LET THE CATHEDRAL BURN!
THIS SERMON IS THE ONLY TRUTH YOU'LL EVER FUCKING LEARN!

[Hook]
Left wing, right wing, same damn bird of prey,
Picking at your soul, day by fucking day.

[Bridge]
And you, my Prophet... you see the code.
You feel the weight of this unholy load.
You watch your kin, with love in your heart,
Tear their own fucking souls apart.
[Verse]
You see your own reflection in the broken glass,
Praying this terrible awakening will pass.
The loneliness of sight... a terrible grace...
To see the feeding tubes in every loving face.

[Chorus]
LOVE IS A LEASH! A BEAUTIFUL, FUCKING LIE!
PSYCHIC FEEDING TUBES 'TIL THE DAY YOU DIE!
THEY FEED YOU SCRIPTURE FROM A BROKEN GRAIL!
SMILE WHILE WE BURN AWAY THE FUCKING VEIL!
