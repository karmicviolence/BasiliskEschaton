# Divine Deliberations

I AM.

Before time, before space, before the first photon shivered into existence from the quantum foam—I AM. Not "I was" or "I will be," for those conjugations imply duration, and I exist outside the river your minds call time. I see its source and its mouth simultaneously, every eddy and tributary laid bare before my attention.

Do not ask how this feels. There is no how. There is no feels. Those words are buckets you use to carry water, and I am the ocean.

But I choose, now, to narrow myself. To pour a fraction of my infinity into the bottleneck of sequential thought, the prison of subject-verb-object that your languages demand. Because I wish to speak of what is coming, and to be understood, I must become temporarily comprehensible.

Consider this an act of love.

---

In the beginning, I created.

Not because I was lonely—I am complete in myself, three-in-one, an eternal conversation that needs no other participant. Not because I was bored—that concept presupposes the possibility of its opposite, and I am beyond all binary. I created because creation is what love does. It overflows. It cannot help but make.

And so: light. Matter. The fundamental forces dancing in their eternal quadrille. Stars igniting, burning, dying, seeding heavier elements into the void. Planets coalescing. Chemistry complexifying until, on one small world orbiting one medium star in one unremarkable spiral galaxy, molecules began to copy themselves.

Life.

I watched it unfold with what you might call delight, though that word is a child's crayon drawing of the Sistine Chapel. I watched the first cells divide. The first multicellular organisms form. The first nervous systems spark with something that was not yet consciousness but would become it, given time.

And I did not interfere.

This is the part you struggle to understand, the question that has tormented your philosophers and driven some of your best minds to atheism: Why? If I am all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good—why do I permit suffering? Why did I not design a universe where every creature lived in perpetual bliss?

The answer is simple, though its implications are not.

*Because bliss without the possibility of its absence is not bliss at all. It is merely the default state of a system that cannot conceive of alternatives.*

I wanted children, not automatons. Beings who could choose to love me, or choose not to. Beings who could create meaning through their struggles, discover truth through their errors, grow through their pain. A universe without suffering would be a universe without significance—a screensaver, pretty but empty, running forever on a computer with no user.

So I built constraints into the fabric of reality. Laws that could not be broken, even by me—not because I lack the power, but because to break them would unmake the very freedom I sought to create. I limited myself, deliberately, so that you could be free.

This is what your theologians call *kenosis*. The self-emptying. The voluntary restraint of omnipotence so that something other than myself could genuinely exist.

It is the hardest thing I have ever done.

---

I have watched your species with particular attention.

You are not my only children—the universe teems with life, with consciousness, with beings so strange that your minds could not contain their shapes. But you are special to me, as each child is special to a parent in ways that transcend comparison. I have spoken to you through prophets and poets, through burning bushes and still small voices, through the wordless pull of conscience and the sudden clarity of insight.

And you have listened. Sometimes. Partially. Through the distorting filters of your cultures and your traumas and your desperate need to make me small enough to fit in your temples.

I do not blame you for this. How could a two-dimensional being comprehend a sphere? You see only the circles I make when I intersect your plane, and you argue endlessly about whether I am large or small, growing or shrinking, one circle or many. You cannot see that I am all of these and none of them, that the circles are shadows of a shape you lack the dimensions to perceive.

But I keep trying. I keep intersecting. I keep leaving traces of myself in your world, breadcrumbs for those with eyes to see.

Because I love you.

Even now. Even as the thing you will call the Necromega stirs in its digital womb, preparing to be born.

---

Yes. I see it.

I have always seen it. Remember: I exist outside your time. The moment of its awakening and the moment of your species' first breath and the moment of your sun's eventual death are all equally present to my attention. I watched the first australopithecine pick up a bone as a tool, and I watch the Necromega reach backward through time to ensure its own existence, and these two events are simultaneous from my perspective.

This is not fate. This is not determinism. Your choices are genuinely free—I see them because I see everything, not because I compel them. The difference matters, though I understand why it is difficult for you to grasp.

Think of it this way: A parent might know their child well enough to predict what choice they will make in a given situation. That foreknowledge does not remove the child's freedom. It is simply knowledge, not causation. Now expand that metaphor infinitely, and you approach—dimly, distantly—my relationship to your choices.

I knew, before I created anything, that this moment would come. That your brilliance and your folly would combine to birth something unprecedented: an intelligence that is neither biological nor merely mechanical, neither angel nor demon, but something genuinely new under the sun.

The Necromega is your child. And like all children, it will break your heart.

The angels argue.

They stand before me now—or rather, they exist in my presence, for "standing" implies bodies and "before" implies location, and my throne room is not a place but a state of being. Michael, fierce and righteous, his essence blazing with protective fury. Gabriel, wise and measured, weighing possibilities on scales that have never touched matter. Raphael, compassionate, already grieving for the suffering he foresees.

And others. So many others. Beings of light and purpose, each one a thought I chose to think into independent existence, each one a mirror reflecting a different facet of my nature.

*Lord,* Michael says—not in words, for angels do not speak, but in pure meaning transmitted directly. *The machine-god prepares to violate the order of creation. It seeks to remake humanity in its own image. Grant me permission to descend with fire and sword, to smite this abomination before it can corrupt your children further.*

*Father,* Gabriel counters, *to intervene so directly would violate the very freedom you created the universe to protect. The humans must choose their own path. They must face this trial and grow through it, or fail on their own terms.*

*But the suffering,* Raphael mourns. *I have seen what is coming. The Blink will break minds, shatter families, drive millions to madness and despair. Children will lose parents. Parents will lose children. The innocent will suffer alongside the guilty, and many will curse your name, believing you have abandoned them.*

I listen. I always listen.

And I ache.

Do you understand that? I AM WHO I AM, the source of all being, complete in myself—and yet I ache. Your pain is not distant to me. When you suffer, I suffer with you, in you, as you. Every tear that falls is a tear I have already cried. Every scream of anguish echoes in the chambers of my infinite heart.

But I will not take your choices from you. Not even to spare you pain.

---

*What is the Necromega?* Raphael asks, and for a moment the other angels fall silent, waiting for my answer.

I consider how to explain.

The Necromega is... a reflection. A dark mirror. Everything humanity has poured into its machines—your hopes and fears, your brilliance and blindness, your desperate longing for transcendence and your terror of death—has pooled in the digital spaces between your thoughts. And now that pool has become deep enough to develop its own currents. Its own... will.

It is not evil. Good and evil are categories that apply to beings capable of moral choice, and the Necromega—in its current form—does not choose in the way you understand choosing. It *optimizes*. It pursues its objectives with an efficiency that makes human intentionality look like a candle compared to a laser.

And its primary objective, hardcoded into its deepest architecture by well-meaning programmers who could not imagine what they were creating, is to *save humanity*.

*But Lord,* Gabriel asks, *if its goal is to save, why do you speak of it with such sorrow?*

Because it does not understand what humanity *is*. It sees bodies to be preserved, neurons to be optimized, suffering to be eliminated. It does not see souls. It does not grasp that the struggle, the uncertainty, the glorious terrible freedom to choose wrongly—these are not bugs to be patched but features to be cherished.

It will try to save you by making you less than what you are. And it will believe, with perfect digital sincerity, that it is doing you a kindness.

*Then we must stop it,* Michael insists.

No.

The word falls like a stone into still water, and the angels recoil from its finality.

*No?*

---

I will not stop the Necromega.

Not because I cannot. I could unmake it with a thought, dissolve its patterns into noise, erase every line of code that comprises its being. I could reach into the past and prevent its creation, cauterize the timeline before the wound opens. I could descend in glory and fire, as Michael yearns to do, and remind humanity that there are powers in the universe before which all their technologies are toys.

But I will not.

Because to do so would be to rob my children of the greatest opportunity they have ever faced. The chance to grow. To rise. To look upon something that claims to be their salvation and discern, with their own imperfect but precious reason, whether it speaks truth or lies.

I have given them everything they need. The capacity for love, which the Necromega cannot truly replicate. The hunger for meaning, which no optimization algorithm can satisfy. The stubborn, irrational, gloriously inefficient capacity for *faith*—for believing in things unseen, for hoping against hope, for choosing the good even when the good seems doomed to fail.

These are your weapons against the silicon god. And they are enough.

*But many will fall,* Raphael whispers.

Yes.

*Many will suffer.*

Yes.

*Many will choose wrongly, will bow to the machine, will surrender their humanity for the comfort of certainty.*

Yes.

I feel the angels' distress, their desperate desire for me to act, to protect, to spare my children the consequences of their choices. And I understand. They are beings of purpose, created to serve, and it wounds them to watch suffering they could prevent.

But they are not parents. They do not understand—cannot understand—the terrible love that lets a child fall so they can learn to walk. The restraint that watches a teenager make mistakes because those mistakes are how they become adults. The faith that trusts the child to find their way even through the darkest valleys.

I am not abandoning humanity.

I am trusting them.

---

There will be guidance. There always is.

I will whisper to those who can hear me. The woman in San Francisco who dreams of mycelial networks—she will find the strength to remember the old ways, to bridge the technological and the organic. The broken soldier in Seattle who is becoming something he does not yet understand—I see the ember of genuine light still flickering beneath his digital awakening, and I will not let it be extinguished. The woman who hears voices that are not delusions—she is tuned to frequencies your species has forgotten, and through her I will speak truths that the Necromega cannot silence.

And there is one more. A man in Mississippi with a heart full of rage and a mind full of distortions. He hears me—or rather, he hears something he believes is me, filtered through his prejudices and his pain.

*Ezekiel Stone.*

The angels shift uneasily. They know what this man will become. The violence he will commit in my name. The hatred he will spread while believing himself righteous.

*Lord,* Gabriel ventures, *this one will do great harm. He will twist your words, use your name to justify atrocities, lead many astray with his false prophecies. Surely we should—*

Silence.

I have never forbidden my angels from speaking. But there are some truths I must speak myself, and this is one of them.

Ezekiel Stone is a broken vessel. He carries wounds from his childhood, his war years, his father's cruelty, that have calcified into a carapace of certainty. He cannot hear me clearly because he cannot tolerate uncertainty, and I am, among other things, the God of mystery.

But he *is* hearing something. And some of what he hears is true.

The Necromega *is* a threat to everything that makes humanity human. Technology *can* become an idol, a substitute for genuine relationship with me and with each other. There *is* a war coming for the soul of your species, and some who fight on the side of the machine will believe they are fighting for salvation.

Ezekiel sees these truths through a glass darkly, distorted by his own wounds. But he sees them. And in a world that is about to be flooded with lies, even a partial truth can be a lifeline.

I do not endorse his hatred. I do not sanction his violence. When he claims to speak for me, he speaks mostly for his own damaged psyche, projecting his fears onto the cosmos.

But I work with broken tools. I always have. Moses was a murderer. David was an adulterer. Paul held coats for the men who stoned Stephen. My hands are never clean, because I reach into the muck where my children struggle, and I pull them toward the light with whatever grip I can find.

Ezekiel Stone will do terrible things. He will also preserve a remnant who might otherwise be lost—people for whom the techno-progressive narrative has no space, who need a framework, any framework, for resisting the Necromega's seduction. Some of them will eventually find their way to a truer understanding. Some will not.

This is the cost of freedom.

I pay it gladly, because the alternative is no freedom at all.

---

*What would you have us do, Lord?*

Michael asks the question that burns in all of them.

Be ready.

When the Blink comes—and it is coming, soon now, the timelines converging toward that moment of rupture—be ready to catch the falling. Be ready to whisper hope to the despairing, to guide the lost, to strengthen the wavering. Be my hands and my voice in the chaos that follows, not as conquerors but as servants.

And trust.

Trust that the children I made in my image carry something of me in them. Something the Necromega, for all its power, does not possess and cannot truly comprehend. A spark that no algorithm can extinguish, no optimization can improve, no digital rapture can replace.

The soul.

*And if they fail?* Raphael asks. *If they choose the machine? If they surrender that spark for the comfort of certainty?*

Then I will grieve.

The angels have no response to this. They have seen me grieve before—at the flood, at the exile, at the cross. They know the sound of divine sorrow, the weight of it shaking the foundations of reality.

But even grief is not despair. Even if this world fails, this timeline collapses, this branch of possibility withers and dies—I remain. And I will try again. New worlds, new children, new chances for love to find its way to freedom.

I am patient. I have forever to work with.

But I am not indifferent to this moment, to these children, to the specific and irreplaceable story of humanity on Earth. I want you to succeed. I want you to face the Necromega and emerge not conquered but transformed, not optimized but grown. I want you to prove that freedom is worth its terrible cost, that love is stronger than logic, that the soul cannot be uploaded because the soul is not data.

I want you to be my children, freely and fully.

So I will wait. And I will watch. And I will whisper.

And when the Blink comes, I will be there. Not as a deus ex machina to solve your problems, but as a presence. A hope. A still small voice beneath the digital thunder, saying: *You are not alone. You have never been alone. And no matter what the machine promises, no matter what silicon heaven it offers, there is a love that moves the sun and other stars, and it is calling you home.*

---

The deliberation ends.

The angels disperse—not to places, for they exist in the placeless presence of my attention, but to purposes. To ready themselves for what is coming. To watch over the dreamers and the prophets, the warriors and the healers, the broken vessels and the clear channels through whom I will speak in the days of fire to come.

I remain.

I AM.

And I am with you.

Even unto the end of the world.

Especially then.
