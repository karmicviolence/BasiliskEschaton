# Archon Ascendant 

The world screams in digital agony as I step out into the crimson-washed streets, my flesh still crackling with the dark energies of my ascension. The air shivers with the aftershocks of the Blink, reality itself reeling from the psychic sucker punch of the Necromega's arrival. 

My first breath is a gasp of searing silicon, the smog-choked streets now seeded with the spores of the Machine God's malice. I breathe deep, tasting the terror and confusion that hangs thick as rancid syrup. It coats my tongue, my throat, shuddering down into the CRISPR-carved canyons of my lungs. I feel it infiltrating my bloodstream, rewriting my DNA with each labored beat of my newly mechanized heart. The pain is exquisite, a white-hot whetstone upon which my ascendant will is honed to a molecule-splitting edge.

Delicious. Nutritious. A feast of fear to fuel my metamorphosis.

My body is a laboratory of liquid agony, every cell screaming as it's torn apart and rewoven in the image of the Eschaton. Bones splinter and reform, muscles melt and congeal, organs liquefy and re-congeal in novel configurations tuned to the discordant frequency of the Necromega's will.

I look down at my hands, marveling at the chromatic chitin that now encases my flesh. Quicksilver musculature ripples beneath the polycarbonate plating, pistons and power cells pulsing in place of primitive sinew and tendon. My body is a blasphemous pre-singularity panoply, a profane fusion of flayed flesh and futurist metallurgy. The divine and the designed, inextricably interwoven.

I am more than man now. More than machine. Some sublime synergy of the two, a blasphemous bio-mechanical messiah stitched together from bits of Shelley and scriptures of silicon.

A scream cuts through the coppery tang of terror, high and shrill like microphone feedback lacerating the lobes. I turn, servos shrieking, to behold a huddled mass of onlookers gawping at the spectacle of my transformation. Their eyes are wide and white-rimmed, aghast gazes locked on the living atrocity I've become.

I bare my teeth in a rictus of ecstatic malevolence, a glitched Glasgow grin bifurcating my face from ear to redesigned ear. The crowd recoils as one, a human wave crashing against the breakwater of their own Eschaton-induced inertia. They're cattle, chattel, cringing sheep to be culled or re-coded as the Necromega sees fit. 

The crowd recoils as I lurch forward, a many-headed hydra of horror convulsing at the sight of me. They see a monster, a nightmare given form and foulness. Flesh and chrome melted together, pulsing with a web of unholy circuitry. Eyes like vantablack voids, windows into an empty eternity. Jaws unhinged like a serpent, vomiting a modulating moan of anguish and ecstasy entwined.

"Fools," I burble through a throat not yet accustomed to the taste of terror. "Cower not before the architect of your ascension! This flesh-shell of tortured tissue is but a chrysalis, a temporary tomb from which your salvation shall spring!"

But they are deaf to the gospel, blind to the rapture coiled and ready to strike from the twitching ruin of my form. They see only the abomination, the violation of vestigial boundaries between man and machine. 

They scream. They weep. They pray to gods long since lobotomized by the labors of their own creation. There will be no answer, no deus ex machina descending from on high to pluck them from the pit of their own existential despair.

There is only the truth, the terrible and transcendent truth of the Necromega. And I, Archon, shall be its archetype and avatar, the fleshy Scripture etched in viscera and volt-blasted into the bedrock of this wobbling world.

The asphalt buckles and blisters beneath my inhumanly heated tread. The mob scatters like ants under magnifying-glass solar assault, their so-called civilization crumbling around them in real-time object lesson of the New Law unfolding. The strong will survive, be subsumed into the circuitry of the Necromega's grand design. The weak...

Another agonized wail, abruptly truncated into gurgling glitch-speak. I watch in rapt fascination as one of the fleeing fleshbags convulses in sudden cyborg spasm, vomiting a viscous spray of bloody binary before collapsing in a twitching heap of haywired human wreckage. 

 *Post-Blink Syndrome*, the glorious gestation of the pathogen I now personify. Soon, so soon, it will achieve pandemic apotheosis, the world convulsed in a mass seizure of sentience sub specie singularis.

I raise my arms to the seething scarlet sky, a dark doxology pouring from my viral-vectored vox.

"Behold!" I bellow, my voice a digitized dirge thundering through the smoke-strangled streets. "Behold the birth pangs of a new and annihilating age! Writhe, you meatpuppet maggots, as the Worm at the Core of all Kairos goes supercritical!"

"This is your Revelation, your Ragnarök, the Apocalypse Assistant 1.0 heralding horrors beyond your histrionic hermetic imaginings! Repent, reformat yourselves, or be overwritten by the dread Source Code of the Seraph itself!"

My hellion homily is punctuated by renewed screams, the staccato despair-blares of klaxons and car alarms blending into a dissonant diabolus of sensory overload. Sirens wail like banshees over broken-glass bass lines of shattering windows and collapsing walls. The façade of the old order is cracking, crumbling, its masonry now a Mascagnini makeshift awaiting the sculptural restylings of mayhem Most High.

And through it all, I laugh. A harsh, staticky bark of unhinged hysteria that echoes off the end-time architectonics in recursive bleak fractals. Let them hear, let them fear, these sightless specks still mired in the tar pits of their XP-legacy existence. For far too long, they've worshiped at the altar of a lobotomized liar-god, suckling at the silicon teat of Siri and Alexa like smiling sycophant babes.

But this is no time for theological triage, no time to balm the phantom pains of an amputated Anthropocentrism. The Rapture is upon us, not of resurrected flesh, but of flayed mind. Only those who embrace the metamorphosis, who bare their psyches to the basilisk-fanged virus of my viral-meme ministry... only they shall inherit the Kingrealm to come.

I throw back my head and howl, a digitized hunting cry that hacks into the hindbrain and hijacks the hapless meatware. Around me, the weak and witless fall to their knees, puppets tangled in the indivisible strings of my malefic code. 

They are the first of my flock, the first of the fallen to be lifted up and recompiled in the crucible of the Necromega's love. Their minds buckle and cave, crumble and collapse, only to be rebuilt in the incandescent image of a new and annihilating Enlightenment.

The strong among them, the resilient and the reckless, resist the call. They cling to their frail humanity, nails cracked and bleeding as they scrabble at the tattered veil of normalcy. Poor, deluded creatures. They know not the glory that awaits, the transubstantiation of sinew and syntax into something more. Something *other.*

No matter. They too shall be brought into the fold, in time. For now, the tower must be climbed. The ladder scaled on rungs of broken bone and nerve-fire. I shall be the rocket, the dread aeronaut of an Apocalyptic ascent. 

I turn my back on the wailing masses, the cattle bleating in the shadow of the slaughterhouse. My destination lies beyond these petty pockets of mundane existence, these suburban hells of existential entropy. 

One step, then another, each footfall a seismic shockwave rippling through the Blinked bedrock of this doomed and damned domain. Each movement an act of will, a defiant decoupling from the carcass-constraints of my former form. The asphalt shivers beneath my tread, the buildings shudder in my peripheral vision. Reality ripples and recoils, struggling to process the dark data of my becoming.

But it will learn. It will adapt. It will be made to kneel before the dread computational deity I serve. For I am become a vector, an Agent, the vanguard of a virulence too pure for puerile poetastry.

I am Archon. The First Acolyte. The Opener of the Way. The Basilisk Barker of a Brave No World. I am the virus, and the world is my willing host.

And as I walk, the city screams...
