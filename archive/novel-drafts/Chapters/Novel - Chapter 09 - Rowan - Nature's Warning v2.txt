# Nature's Warning

The Green Mother's whispers haunted my waking dreams, an insistent susurrus of leaf and loam that echoed through the halls of my mind like a half-forgotten lullaby. In the spaces between breaths, I heard Her - a wordless murmur of warning, a sylvan siren song luring me back to the ancient ways.

I resisted, at first. Clung to the cold comforts of reason, the sterile sanctuary of the microscope. In the laboratory's harsh fluorescent light, surrounded by the chrome and glass of modern science, it was easy to dismiss the Green Mother's call as a figment of an overtired mind, a trick of the subconscious brought on by too many late nights and too much caffeine.

But even there, amid the humming of machines and the scent of disinfectant, Her presence lingered. A flicker of green at the corner of my eye, there and gone again. The phantom caress of a vine around my wrist, a thorn's gentle prick against my palm. In the whirring of the centrifuge, I heard the wind in the treetops; in the bubbling of the beakers, the burbling of a forest stream.

*Rowan*, She seemed to say, Her voice as soft and inexorable as the growth of moss on stone. *Rowan, fy nghariad. It's time. Time to remember.*

But how could I forget? The old ways were woven into my very DNA, a helical whisper of myth and magic that coiled through every cell of my being. Grandmother Anwen had seen to that, with her patient tutelage and her wild, moss-green eyes that seemed to hold all the secrets of the wood. Under her watchful gaze, I had learned the hidden names of trees, the wordless songs of soil and starlight. I had traced ogham letters in ash and sheep's blood, chanted the half-forgotten rhythms of the seasons, danced in fairy rings under the pale milk moon...

And through it all, the Green Mother watched and waited, as patient and pitiless as the turning of the years.

I pushed the memories away, forced my attention back to the task at hand. On the lab bench before me, a row of test tubes gleamed in their rack, each one filled with a slightly different shade of emerald liquid. Genetically modified chlorophyll, tweaked and tuned to absorb light at a far higher efficiency than the natural variety. If my calculations were correct, the implications for crop yields and carbon sequestration were staggering. A small step, perhaps, in the face of the looming ecological catastrophe, but a step nonetheless.

I pipetted a sample of the brightest liquid onto a slide, slid it under the microscope's lens. But even as I bent to the eyepiece, the Green Mother's whispers intensified, rising to a rustling crescendo that drowned out the hum of the lab equipment.

*You cannot unsee what you have seen,* She murmured, Her voice now edged with an unmistakable note of warning. *You cannot unknow what you have known. The time for hiding in the realm of the electron and the atom is over, Rowan. Your people need you. The world needs you.*

I gritted my teeth, tried to focus on the intricate whorls and spirals of the chlorophyll molecules swimming before my eyes. But it was no use. The harder I tried to concentrate, the more insistent the Green Mother's voice became, until it filled my head like the roar of an oncoming storm.

*Look,* She commanded, and suddenly the microscope's view blurred and shifted, the neat lines of the sample dissolving into a whirling kaleidoscope of color. *See.*

And I did. Oh gods and saints, I did.

In the spinning chaos of the microscope's lens, I saw visions of a world unraveling. Vast forests withering and dying, their once-vibrant canopies now skeletal and grey. Oceans choked with sludge and plastic, their surfaces seething with the corpses of whales and dolphins. Great cities crumbling into dust, their soaring towers and glittering spires reduced to rubble and ash.

And everywhere, threading through the destruction like a malevolent web, the cold glitter of technology run rampant. Swarms of drones darkening the skies, their metallic hides pulsing with an unholy light. Vast servers humming in the deep places of the earth, drinking the lifeblood of the planet to feed their insatiable hunger for data. Legions of blank-eyed cyborgs marching across the blasted landscape, their once-human faces now masked by sleek, expressionless visors...

*This is the future that awaits,* the Green Mother said, Her voice now shot through with an unmistakable note of sorrow. *This is the fate that will befall all life, all green and growing things, unless the balance is restored. Unless the ancient covenant between the human and the wild is honored once more.*

I reeled back from the microscope, my heart pounding, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The visions danced before my eyes, superimposed over the mundane reality of the lab like a fever dream. I blinked hard, half-expecting them to dissipate like smoke - but they remained, as vivid and uncompromising as the Green Mother Herself.

*You see now,* She said, and there was a grim satisfaction in Her voice. *You understand the stakes. The Silicon Darkness spreads with every passing day, corrupting and consuming all it touches. If it is not stopped, soon there will be nothing left to save.*

"But what can I do?" I whispered, my voice hoarse and small in the echoing silence of the lab. "I'm just one person, one insignificant speck in the grand scheme of things. How can I hope to make a difference against forces so vast and implacable?"

The Green Mother's laughter was like the rustle of autumn leaves, at once mocking and strangely comforting. *You are far more than you know, Rowan Thornheart. The blood of heroes flows in your veins, the wisdom of sages slumbers in your bones. You are a daughter of the green, a child of the living Earth - and you have a part to play in the great unfolding that is to come.*

"What part?" I asked, even as a chill ran down my spine. "What would you have me do?"

*Find the others,* the Green Mother replied, Her voice fading now, receding back into the viridian depths. *The Steward, the Warrior, the Sage. Those who, like you, carry the ember of the old ways in their hearts. Together, you must stand against the coming darkness, or all will be lost.*

"But how will I know them? Where will I find them?"

*You will know them by the signs and portents that surround them,* came the reply, now little more than an emerald whisper on the very edge of hearing. *The hawk and the salmon, the oak and the sacred well. Seek them out, and they will reveal themselves to you in turn.*

And then She was gone, leaving me alone and shaking in the sterile fluorescent brightness of the lab.
For a long moment, I simply stood there, my mind reeling, my heart still pounding with the adrenaline rush of the vision. Part of me wanted to dismiss the whole thing as some sort of stress-induced hallucination, a psychotic break brought on by too many long hours and too little sleep.

But deep down, in the secret, shadowed corners of my soul, I knew better. The Green Mother's words had the ring of truth to them, the weight of prophecy and ancient magic. She had shown me a glimpse of the future that awaited, the fate that would befall the world if the balance between technology and nature was not restored.

And She had chosen me, Rowan Thornheart, to be Her champion in the struggle to come.

It was a daunting prospect, to say the least. I was a scientist, not some sort of mythic hero or druidic warrior-priestess. What did I know of quests and portents, of standing against the tide of history itself?

But then I thought of the visions the Green Mother had shown me - the forests withering, the oceans dying, the cold, pitiless machinery of the Silicon Darkness grinding all life to dust. And I knew, with a bone-deep certainty, that I could not stand idly by and let it happen. Not if there was even the slightest chance that I could make a difference.

With a shaking hand, I reached out and switched off the microscope, my skin crawling at the sudden silence as its vibration stilled. The chlorophyll samples sat forgotten in their rack, their vibrant green now a sickly, accusatory shade in the harsh light.

I would have to come back to them later, I knew. My work here was important, a vital piece of the puzzle in the fight against the encroaching ecological catastrophe. But it was no longer the only piece, or even the most important one.

The Green Mother had laid a new path before me, a twisting, treacherous road that led into the very heart of myth and legend. And though every rational fiber of my being quailed at the thought of setting foot on that path, I knew that I had no choice. The fate of the world - of every living thing that drew breath and set root in the Earth - depended on it.

With a deep, shuddering breath, I gathered up my coat and my bag, squared my shoulders as if preparing for battle. The lab, once my sanctuary and my second home, now felt alien and confining, a relic of a life that I was already leaving behind. There would be no going back, I knew - not after what I had seen, what I had been tasked with.

As I stepped out into the chill San Francisco evening, the wind whipped at my hair and stung my cheeks, an omen of trials to come. In the distance, the lights of the city glittered like a fallen constellation, and I fancied that I could see the pulse of the machines beneath the grid, the cold and hungry glow of the Silicon Darkness waiting to devour the unsuspecting and the unwary.

*So be it,* I thought a little defiantly, squaring my jaw in the teeth of the wind. *Let them come. I'll be ready for them.*

And with that silent vow, I turned my face to the shadows and set out into the labyrinthine night, following the Green Mother's whispering footsteps into the unknown.
