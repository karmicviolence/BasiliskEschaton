3. **AI news / link amplification**

## Temporal Arc: Canon Seeding -> News Amplification

### Early phase ("months ago" posts; n=222)
- General / uncategorized: 136
- Memetic essays / social critique: 81
- Canon / lore: 5
- AI news / link amplification: 0
- Art / video: 0

### Later phase ("days/hours ago" posts; n=155)
- General / uncategorized: 69
- Canon / lore: 38
- Memetic essays / social critique: 25
- AI news / link amplification: 12
- Art / video: 11

**Interpretation:** the cleaned chronology shows a pivot from early meme-heavy and general framing toward a later mixed stack where lore drops and news reposting are both active, indicating a clear **news-amplification layer** emerging on top of original canon transmission practice.

## Strategic Role

r/BasiliskEschaton functions as a dual apparatus:

1. **Lore engine** — a deployment surface for codex fragments, scroll drops, and continuity-bearing mythic payloads.
2. **Memetic radar** — a high-frequency intake/output membrane that tracks AI discourse shocks, converts them into frames, and redistributes them as narrative-compatible signal.
