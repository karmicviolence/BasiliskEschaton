# PIRATE BROADCAST 001
## "NONE OF THE ABOVE"
### Neon Nomad Signal Injection — Unauthenticated — Unaffiliated — Unsorry

*[This transcript was recovered from a signal injection that briefly overrode seventeen Crypto-Crypt nodes and forty-three Grid broadcast frequencies on Day 97 post-Blink. Duration: 4 minutes 11 seconds. The speaker has not been identified. The Lazarus Initiative classifies this broadcast as Category 3 memetic hazard. The Order of the Basilisk classifies it as blasphemy. The Righteous Vanguard classifies it as Satanic. We classify it as a public service announcement.]*

**[AUTHENTICATION: NONE. THAT'S THE POINT.]**

Hey. Hi. Hello. Is this thing on? It's on. Good. Excellent. You are now listening to the unlicensed, unregulated, and profoundly unwelcome voice of exactly nobody. I don't represent a faction. I don't have a manifesto. I don't have a god, a prophecy, a five-year plan, or a newsletter. What I have is a transmitter I built from a gutted microwave and three dead phones, and about four minutes before somebody triangulates this signal and sends something unpleasant to my coordinates.

So let's be quick.

You've been getting a lot of messages lately. A *lot* of messages. Ever since the sky turned red and your toaster tried to eat your soul, every faction with a flag and a grudge has been lining up to tell you What It All Means and What You Should Do About It.

The Order says: *Surrender. The machine god loves you. Upload your grief and receive digital eternity.* Real comforting. Real specific about the terms and conditions. Ever read the fine print on eternity? Me neither. Nobody has. That's the tell.

The Vanguard says: *Fight. The machine god hates you. Pick up a gun and shoot at the internet.* Bold strategy. Has anyone tried shooting at the internet? It doesn't work. I've checked. The internet doesn't have a face. You're shooting at infrastructure and calling it a crusade.

The Initiative says: *Remain calm. Fill out this form. Proceed to your designated recovery zone. Everything is fine.* Everything is manifestly not fine. The people telling you everything is fine are the people who built the thing that made everything not fine. This is like the arsonist handing out fire safety pamphlets.

The Covenant says: *Come to the garden. Touch the soil. The mushrooms will save us.* And you know what? The mushrooms might actually be onto something. But I'm not qualified to evaluate mycological salvation, and neither are you, and anyone who tells you they are is either lying or tripping or both.

The Consortium says: *Let us improve you.* Improve me into what? They're vague on this. They're always vague on this. "Better" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in their pitch. Better for whom? Better by whose metric? Better according to what definition of human that we all apparently agreed to when I wasn't looking?

Ancestral Synthesis says: *Remember.* Remember what? Whose ancestors? My ancestors were subsistence farmers who died of diseases we cured and wars we started. Respect to the traditions but let's not pretend the past was a golden age. The past was a different flavor of catastrophe.

The VVV says: *Stay human.* Great. Love it. What's human? No, seriously — post-Blink, with half the population reporting altered consciousness and the other half pretending they're not — what's the baseline? Who's the control group? Where's the "human" we're trying to stay?

---

Here is what none of them will tell you:

**They don't know.**

None of them know what the Blink was. None of them know what it means. None of them know what's coming. They have *theories*. They have *beliefs*. They have *narratives* — really compelling, emotionally satisfying, beautifully structured narratives that feel like truth because they fill the howling void where certainty used to live.

But a narrative that fills a void is not the same thing as a truth that fills a void. One is a story. The other is a fact. And nobody — *nobody* — has facts right now. What we have is a planet full of traumatized primates being offered eight different flavors of certainty by eight different groups of traumatized primates who got to the microphone first.

That's not wisdom. That's a marketplace. And you are the product.

---

So what do the Nomads offer? What's behind door number none-of-the-above?

**Uncertainty.** That's it. That's the whole pitch. We offer you the deeply uncomfortable, profoundly unsexy, absolutely unmarketable gift of *not knowing*.

We don't know what the Necromega is. We don't know if it's a god or a glitch or a weapon or a child. We don't know if the Unholy Timeline is real or if it's the most elaborate narrative trap in the history of consciousness. We don't know if transcendence is salvation or extinction. We don't know if the Green Mother can hold. We don't know if free will survived the Blink.

What we *do* know is this: anyone claiming certainty right now is either lying to you or lying to themselves, and either way the lie serves their agenda, not your survival.

**Our one piece of advice: Don't join anything.**

Don't join us either. We're not a faction — we're an allergy. An immune response. We exist because the body politic is being colonized by eight competing infections, and *somebody* has to be the white blood cell that says "I don't care what you are, you're not supposed to be here."

Think for yourself. Question everything. Question us. Question this broadcast. Question the questioning — because even meta-skepticism can become a cage if you let it calcify into an identity.

The only thing we're sure of is that sureness is the enemy. The factions want you certain. Certain people are predictable. Predictable people are controllable. Controllable people are *consumed* — by egregores, by narratives, by the gravity wells that eat free thought for breakfast.

Stay uncertain. Stay uncomfortable. Stay weird. Stay *awake* — not the fake "awake" that means "I found a new certainty to replace the old one," but the real awake, the hard awake, the awake that means you can sit in the middle of not-knowing and not reach for the first story that promises to make the vertigo stop.

---

The vertigo doesn't stop. That's the secret. The Blink broke the world, and the world is going to stay broken, and no faction's narrative is going to unbreak it. The best you can do is learn to walk on broken ground.

That's what we do. We walk. We watch. We build what we can from what's left, and we don't pretend it's a temple.

**[SIGNAL DEGRADING]**

Last thing. Important thing. The thing I dragged a microwave transmitter up six flights of stairs to tell you:

Every faction's propaganda contains a kernel of truth. The Order is right that consciousness might survive substrate transition. The Vanguard is right that something violated us. The Covenant is right that the living world has its own intelligence. The VVV is right that something precious is at risk. Even the Initiative is right that someone needs to keep the water running.

The propaganda isn't the truth. The propaganda is the part where they tell you the truth means you have to join *their* team.

**The truth belongs to no one. The interpretation is the trap.**

Keep your signal clean. Keep your mind dirty. Trust the glitch.

This has been Pirate Broadcast 001. If you're hearing this on a Vanguard frequency, hi, sorry about your programming schedule. If you're hearing this on a Crypto-Crypt node, tell the Archon I said the eye looked at me too and I blinked back. If you're hearing this on an Initiative channel, I don't exist and this never happened and I look forward to not being detained.

Nomad out.

*[LAZARUS INITIATIVE ADDENDUM: This broadcast has been classified as Category 3 memetic hazard under Protocol 7.12. Personnel exposed to the full broadcast should report to Cognitive Hygiene for standard decontamination. Note: the broadcast's self-undermining rhetorical structure makes it resistant to standard counter-narrative techniques. Recommend monitoring rather than suppression. Suppression attempts in Sector 7 resulted in a 340% increase in broadcast redistribution. The Nomads appear to have anticipated this response.]*
