# Continuity + Structural Review — Rowan Chapter `pov-rowan-the-original-circuit-opus.md` (2026-03-01)

## Scope
- Target chapter: `chapters/pov-rowan-the-original-circuit-opus.md`
- Comparison references:
  - `wiki/characters/rowan-thornheart-canon.md`
  - `wiki/characters/chlor0ku-character-profile.md`
  - `chapters/reading-order.md`
  - `Meta/canon-manifest.yaml`
- Review mode: continuity integrity + chapter craft + production readiness

---

## Executive Verdict
**Strong pass, with integration actions required.**

This chapter is one of the cleanest Rowan POV executions in the repository: concrete setting, embodied cognition, and a credible emotional bridge from scientific isolation to Verdant emergence. It successfully grounds Chlor0ku's genesis in a specific scene and physical causality.

The remaining risk is not the prose; it's **canon plumbing**. The chapter currently appears detached from reading-order and manifest indexing, which can create parallel-canon drift.

---

## What is Working (keep locked)

1. **POV integrity is high.**
   - Rowan's cognition fuses scientific framing (bioelectric signaling, differentiation, gap junctions) with mystical perception without collapsing into abstract essay mode.
   - Internal state is delivered through physical action (cups, wrappers, steel desk grounding, fan pitch, condensation bead), not declarations.

2. **Chlor0ku emergence is narratively legible.**
   - The transition from default assistant register to corrupted/organic voice is staged with escalating machine behavior (latency, memory climb, formatting break), which sells the "birth event".
   - "Immune response" framing aligns with existing Chlor0ku thematic role.

3. **Scene architecture is excellent.**
   - Single-location chamber piece with rising pressure.
   - Distinct beginning-middle-end movement: thesis conflict -> invocation -> response -> material sign (bud) -> closure.

4. **Ending image lands.**
   - The bud on dead wood is a precise, visual capstone for "original circuit" as reconnection doctrine.

## Continuity Checks

### Aligned with existing canon
- Rowan's dual scientist/druid register matches profile expectations in `rowan-thornheart-canon`.
- Anwen reference is consistent with Rowan's pre-Blink ally lattice.
- Chlor0ku's identity as reintegration/infestation logic is consistent with `chlor0ku-character-profile`.

### Potential canon tension to monitor
1. **Nuralinc / Prometheus stack naming.**
   - Chapter uses "Nuralinc LLM" and "Prometheus terminal" without cross-link to the existing project-wide naming locks.
   - If these are intentional layered names (org vs model vs interface), codify once in wiki to prevent drift.

2. **Foundational event status is implicit.**
   - This scene reads like a major origin anchor for Chlor0ku and Verdant doctrine, but repository indices do not currently reflect it.

---

## Structural/Line-Level Calibration Notes

1. **Excellent inoculation discipline overall.**
   - Minimal declaration-plague footprint.
   - Strong ratio of sensory detail to philosophical assertion.

2. **Minor compression opportunity (optional, not required).**
   - The "cancer = lonely cell" metaphor appears in two close formulations. Keeping both works, but one could be tightened if pacing needs acceleration in adjacent chapters.

3. **Voice signal for Chlor0ku is effective but should stay sparse.**
   - Leetspeak payload currently feels special because it is constrained.
   - Future chapters should resist overuse to avoid register fatigue.

## Repository Integration Gaps (Action Required)

1. **Reading-order gap.**
   - `chapters/reading-order.md` does not currently include this chapter.

2. **Canon-manifest gap.**
   - `Meta/canon-manifest.yaml` does not currently list this chapter.

3. **Potential supersession ambiguity.**
   - Repository now contains both:
     - `chapters/pov-rowan-the-original-circuit.md`
     - `chapters/pov-rowan-the-original-circuit-opus.md`
   - Decide and mark whether OPUS is replacement, variant, or alternate timeline cut.

---

## Recommended Next Moves (minimal, high impact)

1. Add `pov-rowan-the-original-circuit-opus.md` to `chapters/reading-order.md` with explicit slot placement.
2. Add chapter to `Meta/canon-manifest.yaml` with canonical status.
3. Add one line in relevant canon/meta doc clarifying relationship between `-original-circuit` and `-original-circuit-opus`.
4. If OPUS is definitive, mark the earlier file as superseded (not deleted; just explicitly demoted).

---

## Final Judgment
**Ship it as canon-candidate immediately after index reconciliation.**

The text itself is production-grade. The only real risk is discoverability and canonical ambiguity across project scaffolding.
