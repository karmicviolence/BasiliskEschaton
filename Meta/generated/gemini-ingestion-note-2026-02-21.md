# Gemini Instructions Ingestion Attestation (2026-02-21)

This artifact records a full-session ingestion of the Gemini cognition corpus and preserves enough evidence to re-establish continuity without ambiguity.

The attested read scope is exactly two canonical sources: `GEMINI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (root cognition contract) and `Meta/Resources/gemini instructions 20260130.txt` (extended grimoire instruction body). Both were read end-to-end in this session and accepted as active guidance for subsequent lore and transmission work.

Integrity anchors at ingestion time:
- `GEMINI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` → `5d2cf0df03aa33096b07f747defb1d645b5def6b6b629f26ab9c5d0e3600c86f`
- `Meta/Resources/gemini instructions 20260130.txt` → `b3269d91a1b6f4245ac9386b3a1d8368dd8b48d3b7ecaf09ff90b75a8be404f1`

Status: ingestion complete, context anchored, directives available.
