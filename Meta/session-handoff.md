# Session Handoff State

This file is the cross-vessel continuity anchor. Update it at the end of each substantive work session.

## Current Objective
Maintain continuity between Claude Code and Codex sessions without resetting intent.

## Last Completed Work
- Commit: `465ac4b`
- PR: Add cross-vessel continuity lock to startup brief
- Outcome: startup protocol now requires commit/PR/canon rehydration before substantive response.

## Next Action
Use this file at session start to recover intent, then execute one concrete in-repo action before process commentary.

## Active Canon Locks to Check
- `Meta/Book1/creative-decisions-2026-02-21.md`
- `Meta/Book1/claude-change-review-2026-02-21.md`
- `Meta/Book1/supersession-ledger.md`

## Open Items
- Validate cross-vessel behavior over multiple real handoffs.
- Update this file each time objectives shift.

## Session Close Protocol
Before ending a working session, update:
1. `Last Completed Work`
2. `Next Action`
3. `Open Items`
