# Rowan Thornheart

## Character Introduction

* **Name:** Rowan Thornheart (née Marshall)
* **Pre-Blink Persona:** Brilliant but conflicted biology student at UC Berkeley, secretly struggling to reconcile her scientific education with her family's druidic heritage.
* **Post-Blink Persona:** The Mycophant, a powerful techno-druid who bridges the gap between ancient mysticism and cutting-edge science. Founder of the Verdant Covenant. (Note: The Mycophant transformation is the twist ending of Book 2, not Book 1.)

## Key Relationships

* **John Raven:** The romance. Rowan receives cryptic visions from the Green Mother that compel her to seek out a specific person — a man with audio-tactile synesthesia who speaks to machines without knowing it. She finds John. She knows things about his gift that he doesn't know himself. She teaches him that what he calls "muttering to machines" has a name: technopaganism. She physically extracts him from his warehouse job before 3-letter agents arrive to kidnap him, days before the Blink. The romance is the obvious cliché — deliberately. That's part of the design.
* **The Green Mother:** The source of Rowan's visions. A personification of nature itself — or possibly a genuine Celtic deity. (Open question: may be renamed to a specific deity like Brigid or Danu.) The Green Mother communicates through dreams, ecological anomalies, and increasingly direct signals as the Blink approaches. The Green Mother begins as unnamed sensation (Slot 16) — a sentence appears in Rowan's notes that she didn't write.
* **Anwen / Proto-Verdant Cell:** Rowan meets allies pre-Blink (Slot 41) and commits to a ritualized plan to protect a location in SF.

## Cognitive Style

* Thinks in interconnected ecosystems — the world as a vast web of relationships
* Processes through both scientific analysis and intuitive mystical insight
* Experiences prophetic visions, especially in deep communion with nature
* Excels at pattern recognition across disparate fields — genetics to ancient lore
* "Feels" the health and energy of her surroundings — a sense that intensifies as the Blink approaches

## Narrative Style

Rowan's POV chapters reflect her dual nature as scientist and druid:

* Rich, sensory descriptions of the natural world, often personifying natural elements
* Integration of scientific terminology with poetic, mythic language
* Metaphors that blend biological concepts with mystical imagery
* Alternating between objective analytical observations and deeply personal emotional reflections
* Scientific notation alongside ancient Gaelic phrases or incantations
* Vivid descriptions of visions that blend reality with symbolic and prophetic elements
* The Berkeley/SF Bay Area as a living character — specific logistics, real places

## Character Arc

* **The Dual Life (Phase I):** Rowan balances her biology studies at Berkeley with the whispers of her druidic heritage. She excels academically but feels torn. Ecology as sensor array: she notices things wrong with the trees (Slot 03). A crimson-eye pattern appears in nature.

* **The Green Mother's Call (Phase I-II):** Rowan's visions intensify. The Green Mother signal begins — unnamed but felt (Slot 16). A sentence appears in her notes she didn't write. "Who is 'we'?" Rowan follows an impossible coordinate (Slot 10) — the biosphere "pings" back. She names "Silicon Darkness" even before she knows what it is (Slot 22).

* **Berkeley to SF (Phase II-III):** Rowan follows the signal from Berkeley toward San Francisco. She sees Ezekiel's recruitment post on a flyer (Slot 29). She meets Anwen and proto-Verdant allies (Slot 41). She commits to a plan. Green counter-doctrine forms: living systems versus silicon (Slot 36). The trees say it's war.

* **Finding John (Phase III-IV):** The visions crystallize around a specific person. Rowan tracks John down. She knows about his synesthesia, his gift with machines, his role in what's coming. She teaches him technopaganism. The atheist materialist starts to believe — not in gods, but in the interconnection his own synesthesia has been showing him all along.

* **The Extraction (late Phase IV):** Rowan physically extracts John from his job before intelligence agents arrive. She knows they're coming. She can't explain how she knows. She just knows. This is the moment the romance locks in — life-or-death trust before they've had time to build it naturally.

* **Seeds of Change (Slot 57):** Green cell mobilizes. A message: "Prepare for the Blink." Rowan identifies a "node" where the Blink will be felt hardest (Slot 54). She can't stop it, but she can shape survivability.

* **Nature's Counter-Ritual (Phase V, Slot 70):** Rowan attempts a counter-ritual during the Blink. Nature as shield. Does it hold? It holds for seconds. Those seconds matter.

* **Post-Book 1:** Rowan founds the Verdant Covenant from the proto-cell she gathered pre-Blink. Book 2: the faction grows but is decimated in the three-faction battle. Key allies die. Rowan turns to the dark magic of the soulshroom. Book 2 twist ending: The Mycophant rises — Rowan transformed, the Verdant Covenant reborn as something far more dangerous and powerful.
