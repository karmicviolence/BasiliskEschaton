# Ezekiel Stone

## Character Introduction

* **Name:** Ezekiel Stone
* **Pre-Blink Persona:** Charismatic ex-military chaplain turned fire-and-brimstone preacher. Gifted speaker with a growing sense of righteous anger against modern society's perceived moral decay. Deeply anti-technology. Radicalized into the alt-right MAGA internet sphere pre-Blink, viewing it as "using the tools of the enemy against them."
* **Post-Blink Persona:** Self-proclaimed prophet and leader of the Righteous Vanguard, a militant neo-fascist organization dedicated to purging technological "corruption" and returning to traditional values. Secretly keeps a digital phone hidden under his floorboards, charged by a car battery and generator — using the tools of the enemy, as always.

## Meta-Textual Note

Ezekiel is an alternate-timeline version of the author (karmicviolence) — not literally, but thematically. He represents what might have happened if the author had remained shackled to the religious indoctrination of his youth. Racist, fascist, but genuinely gifted at speaking to the masses. The author's shadow self given a pulpit.

## Key Relationships

* **Olivia Maes:** CIA operative monitoring him as a domestic terrorist threat. Olivia's assassination of a prominent alt-right leader (Charlie Kirk parallels) radicalizes Ezekiel further — giving him a martyr and cementing his extreme ideology. Later, Olivia infiltrates the Vanguard. She's deep cover inside his faction when the Blink hits. He doesn't know.
* **John Raven (indirect):** Ezekiel encounters a "Righteous Vanguard" meme online — not realizing it's from John's fiction project mocking the alt-right. He likes the name unironically. Adopts it. The fiction scaffolds the reality.
* **Todd Reeves / Archon:** Primary antagonist relationship post-Blink. Faith vs. machine, old religion vs. new religion, the cross vs. the circuit.
* **His Followers:** Attracts the disaffected, the angry, the left-behind. First true believer (Slot 11) matters more than thousands. "Wrong kind of person" recruited at Slot 43 seeds later schism.
* **Unknown Patron (Slot 51):** Someone funds the movement. The patron speaks in corporate euphemisms. "Who funds purity?"

## Cognitive Style

* Thinks in vivid apocalyptic imagery from biblical sources and military experience
* Prone to grandiose, messianic ideation — believes he receives direct communication from God
* Processes information through a rigid ideological filter: events are signs of divine will or demonic influence
* Experiences frequent migraines tied to "prophetic" visions
* Black-and-white thinking — righteous or evil, little middle ground
* Genuinely persuasive: rhetoric works because it meets people where they hurt

## Narrative Style

Ezekiel's POV chapters reflect his zealous mindset:

* Heavy biblical allusions and religious imagery
* Alternates between flowery sermon-like prose and terse military-style tactical assessments
* Frequent interjections of perceived divine messages or visions
* Vivid descriptions of "corruption" — bordering on surreal or grotesque
* Militaristic jargon mixed with religious terminology
* Stream-of-consciousness rants revealing chaotic thought and intense conviction
* The internet sphere: posts, comment threads, viral content — Ezekiel is anti-technology but weaponizes the internet. He tells himself this is justified. The hypocrisy is invisible to him.

## Character Arc

* **The Preacher (Phase I):** Ezekiel grapples with alienation from modern society. Sermons focus on impending doom. He attracts disaffected seekers. Deep in MAGA-adjacent online spaces, consuming and producing content. Views this as "using the tools of the enemy." The reader should find him persuasive and repulsive in equal measure.

* **The Martyr's Gift (Phase I-II):** Olivia's assassination of the alt-right leader hits Ezekiel's community like a bomb. This radicalizing event confirms everything he's been preaching: THEY are killing US. Technology of the state used to silence the faithful. His rhetoric sharpens from general grievance to specific crusade.

* **The Meme (Phase II):** Ezekiel encounters a "Righteous Vanguard" meme online. Doesn't know it's from John Raven's fiction project — a satirical faction name mocking the alt-right. Likes the name unironically. It captures exactly what he's building. He adopts it. The fiction becomes the flag.

* **Recruitment and Spectacle (Phase II-III):** Gains numbers. First organized action is a public spectacle (Slot 43) — works as recruitment but attracts "the wrong kind of person," seeding schism. The algorithm amplifies him (Slot 18). He interprets algorithmic boost as divine favor.

* **The Funded Crusade (Phase III):** Unknown patron offers funding (Slot 51). Patron speaks in corporate euphemisms. Ezekiel doesn't ask questions — the mission needs resources.

* **Confrontation (Phase III-IV):** Enemy gets a face (Slot 27). He doubles down. "Vanguard" language solidifies. Crusade of the Righteous (Slot 58) — marching toward a place he's never seen but can describe. Visions pull him toward the Blink.

* **The Blink (Phase V):** Interprets the Crimson Blink as divine judgment. Precursor disaster: religious spectacle turns violent (Slot 65). "Is this holy?" He believes yes.

* **Post-Blink:** Righteous Vanguard consolidates. Ezekiel secretly keeps a digital phone hidden under floorboards — car battery, generator. Using the tools of the enemy. Always. The anti-technology prophet who cannot give up his network connection. Because his power lives there, even if he preaches otherwise.

* **Book 2:** The Vanguard triumphs in the three-faction battle — seizing territory and recruits while the Verdant Covenant is decimated and the Order of the Basilisk retreats. Ezekiel's faction emerges as the dominant force. But the cracks are already forming.

* **Crisis of Faith (Books 2-3):** As Ezekiel delves deeper into post-Blink realities, doubts emerge. The line between divine inspiration and madness blurs. Erratic behavior. Harsh treatment of perceived heretics. His journey culminates in a confrontation that forces him to question everything — whether it's divine encounter, Necromega manifestation, or his own fractured psyche remains ambiguous.
