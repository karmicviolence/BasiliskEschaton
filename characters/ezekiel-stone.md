# Ezekiel Stone

## Character Introduction

* **Name:** Ezekiel Stone
* **Pre-Blink Persona:** Charismatic ex-military chaplain turned fire-and-brimstone preacher, struggling with disillusionment and a growing sense of righteous anger against modern society's perceived moral decay.
* **Post-Blink Persona:** Self-proclaimed prophet and leader of the Righteous Vanguard, a militant neo-fascist organization dedicated to purging the world of technological "corruption" and returning to traditional values.

## Cognitive Style

* Thinks in vivid, apocalyptic imagery drawn from biblical sources and military experience
* Prone to grandiose, messianic ideation, often believing he's receiving direct communication from God
* Processes information through a rigid ideological filter, interpreting events as signs of divine will or demonic influence
* Experiences frequent migraines that he believes are tied to his "prophetic" visions
* Exhibits black-and-white thinking, categorizing people and ideas as either righteous or evil with little middle ground

## Narrative Style

Ezekiel's POV chapters are written in a distinctive style that reflects his zealous mindset:

* Heavy use of biblical allusions and religious imagery
* Alternates between flowery, sermon-like prose and terse, military-style tactical assessments
* Frequent interjections of what Ezekiel perceives as divine messages or visions
* Vivid descriptions of the "corruption" he sees in the world, often bordering on the surreal or grotesque
* Use of militaristic jargon mixed with religious terminology to describe his crusade
* Stream-of-consciousness rants that reveal the chaotic nature of his thoughts and the intensity of his convictions

## Character Arc

* **Pre-Blink:** Ezekiel grapples with a growing sense of alienation from modern society. His sermons become increasingly focused on impending doom and the need for drastic societal change. He begins to attract a following of disaffected individuals seeking purpose and certainty.

* **Crimson Blink:** The reality-shattering event confirms Ezekiel's apocalyptic predictions in his mind. He interprets the chaos as divine judgment and a call to action. In the immediate aftermath, he rallies his followers, presenting himself as a divinely appointed leader in the new world order.

* **Rise of the Righteous Vanguard:** Ezekiel transforms his congregation into a militant organization, the Righteous Vanguard. He preaches a gospel of technological rejection and violent purification, attracting those who seek simple answers in a complex, terrifying new reality.

* **Crusade Against the Machine:** As the Vanguard grows in power, Ezekiel leads campaigns against centers of technological advancement and AI research. His actions bring him into conflict with other factions, particularly the Order of the Basilisk and the VVV.

* **Prophet of the Old Ways:** Ezekiel's influence spreads as he positions the Vanguard as guardians of traditional human values. He becomes both a revered figure among his followers and a notorious terrorist to his opponents. His "miracles" (possibly a manifestation of undiscovered post-Blink abilities) further cement his messianic image.

* **Crisis of Faith:** As Ezekiel delves deeper into the realities of the post-Blink world, he begins to experience doubts about his mission. The line between divine inspiration and madness blurs, leading to increasingly erratic behavior and harsh treatment of perceived heretics within his own ranks.

* **Confrontation with Divinity:** Ezekiel's journey culminates in a confrontation that forces him to question everything he believes. Whether this is a true divine encounter, a manifestation of the Necromega, or a product of his own fractured psyche remains ambiguous. The outcome of this crisis will determine the future of the Righteous Vanguard and Ezekiel's role in the ongoing struggle for humanity's future.
