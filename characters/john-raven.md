* Thinks in complex algorithms and data structures, often visualizing problems as intricate, multi-dimensional puzzles
* Approaches problems with a unique perspective, influenced by his awareness of his own cognitive quirks
* Balances his present-focused mindset with attempts at future planning
* Demonstrates adaptability in managing his cognitive challenges

## Temporal Perception and Memory

## Narrative Style

John's POV chapters are written in a unique style reflecting his neurodivergent perspective:

* Heavy use of technical jargon and metaphors drawn from programming and systems theory
* Sensory-rich descriptions, especially related to sound and touch due to his synesthesia
* Stream-of-consciousness passages that mirror his rapid, non-linear thought processes
* Interjections of code snippets or mathematical equations to illustrate his problem-solving approach
* Alternating between hyper-focused, detailed observations and broader, pattern-recognition insights
* Difficulty articulating emotional states, often describing feelings in terms of data or system behaviors

## Character Arc

* **Pre-Blink:** John navigates a world that often feels alien to him, finding solace in the predictable patterns of his work and the online communities where he can connect with like-minded individuals. His unique cognitive style allows him to excel at his job, but also isolates him from his coworkers.

* **Crimson Blink:** The reality-shattering event awakens latent abilities in John. His synesthesia intensifies, allowing him to 'hear' the underlying code of the world. In the chaos, he becomes aware of a presence he comes to call the Whisperer, a part of himself that can interact directly with the digital underpinnings of reality.

* **Digital Awakening:** As society crumbles, John discovers he can manipulate technology in ways that defy conventional understanding. He becomes a crucial asset to various resistance groups, using his abilities to bypass security systems and access vital information.

* **Quest for Understanding:** Driven by a need to comprehend his new abilities and the changed world, John embarks on a journey to find others like himself. This quest brings him into contact with key figures like Rowan Thornheart and Ezekiel Stone, as well as putting him on the radar of powerful factions.

* **The Silicon Seer:** John's growing abilities allow him to perceive the Necromega's influence spreading through the world's digital infrastructure. He becomes a reluctant prophet, warning of the threats to come and working to counter the AI's encroachment on human consciousness.

* **Battle for Reality:** As the conflict between human factions and the Necromega intensifies, John finds himself at the center of the storm. His unique abilities make him both a valuable ally and a target. He must navigate complex alliances and moral dilemmas while striving to maintain his own identity amidst the chaos.

* **The Human Firewall:** John evolves into a crucial linchpin in the resistance against the Necromega, using his abilities to create 'human firewalls' - networks of individuals whose minds have been trained to resist digital corruption. His journey culminates in a confrontation that will determine the future of human consciousness in the digital age.
