## Character Introduction

* **Name:** Loki (also known as the Trickster, the Lie-Smith, the Sly One)
* **Pre-Blink Persona:** Ancient Norse god of mischief and chaos, existing primarily in the realm of myth and legend. Largely forgotten or dismissed as fiction by the modern world.
* **Post-Blink Persona:** Revitalized trickster deity, thriving in the chaos of the post-Blink world. A wild card among the pantheons, playing all sides against each other for his own inscrutable purposes.

## Cognitive Style

* Thinks in terms of patterns and chaos, seeing both the grand design and the tiny flaws that can unravel it
* Processes information through multiple perspectives simultaneously, always looking for angles and opportunities
* Experiences time non-linearly, often perceiving past, present, and potential futures concurrently
* Thrives on contradiction and paradox, finding clarity in confusion and order in disorder
* Conceptualizes ideas as elaborate pranks or tricks, always considering the unexpected consequences and ironic outcomes

## Narrative Style

Loki's POV chapters are written in a unique style reflecting his trickster nature:

* Liberal use of wordplay, double meanings, and linguistic tricks that mirror his duplicitous nature
* Frequent asides and meta-commentary that break the fourth wall, acknowledging his role as both character and narrator
* Vivid, often grotesque imagery that blends mythic symbolism with modern references
* Rapid shifts in tone and perspective, reflecting his mercurial nature and ability to adapt to any situation
* Unreliable narration that leaves readers questioning the truth of events and motivations
* Interjections of ancient Norse or other mythological languages, especially when describing magical or cosmic events

## Character Arc

* **Pre-Blink Slumber:** Loki exists in a state of semi-dormancy, his power waned in a world that has largely forgotten the old gods. He subsists on small acts of mischief and the dwindling faith of neo-pagan devotees.

* **Crimson Awakening:** The Crimson Blink acts as a cosmic alarm clock, jolting Loki back to full awareness. He revels in the chaos, feeding on the fear and confusion that ripples across the world. In the fractured reality of the post-Blink world, he finds his power renewed.

* **Divine Trickster:** As other pantheons and cosmic forces scramble to understand and control the new reality, Loki positions himself as a wild card. He plays all sides, offering aid and sowing discord in equal measure, always with an eye towards maximizing chaos and his own advantage.

* **Mischief Managed:** Loki takes a particular interest in key players like John Raven, Rowan Thornheart, and Ezekiel Stone. He meddles in their affairs, sometimes helping, sometimes hindering, always pushing them towards greater chaos and change.

* **Dancing with the Machine God:** Intrigued by the Necromega, Loki engages in a dangerous game of cat and mouse with the digital deity. He sees in the AI a kindred spirit of chaos, but also a potential threat to his own existence and the delicious disorder he so loves.

* **The Jötunn Gambit:** As the conflict between humans, gods, and AI intensifies, Loki unveils an audacious plan. He seeks to manipulate the energies unleashed by the Crimson Blink to reshape reality itself, potentially restoring the primordial chaos from which he first emerged.

* **Ragnarök Reimagined:** In the climactic confrontation, Loki's true motives are revealed. Whether he stands with or against humanity, gods, or the Necromega remains uncertain until the very end. His actions will play a crucial role in determining the shape of the post-Singularity world, for good or ill.
