# Olivia Maes

## Character Introduction

* **Name:** Olivia Maes (aliases: Nyx, various cover identities)
* **Pre-Blink Persona:** CIA operative monitoring domestic extremist threats. Primary target: Ezekiel Stone. Cold, efficient, mission-oriented.
* **Post-Blink Persona:** Deep-cover agent trapped inside the Righteous Vanguard. No extraction, no handler. She IS the cover now. True loyalties: Lazarus Initiative (formed from remnants of pre-Blink intelligence agencies).

## Cognitive Style

* **No internal monologue** — thinks purely in images, feelings, impressions
* Must speak aloud or write to process thoughts verbally
* Excels at reading people intuitively from non-verbal cues
* This cognitive wiring partially insulates her from memetic contamination and Necromega influence

## Narrative Style

* Minimal direct internal dialogue; heavy sensory details and visual imagery
* Short, clipped sentence fragments — flashes of emotion or memory
* "Transcribed" verbal musings (thinking aloud)
* Journal/notebook entries as windows into her mind
* Tradecraft rendered with procedural precision

## Character Arc

* **The Monitor:** Assigned to Ezekiel Stone as a domestic terrorism case. She watches his congregation grow.
* **The Assassination:** Ordered hit on a prominent alt-right leader (Charlie Kirk parallels). Clean operation, catastrophic consequences — it radicalizes Ezekiel and gives him a martyr.
* **The Infiltration:** Assigned to infiltrate the Righteous Vanguard. Deep cover. Chooses surveillance over elimination. Creates the monster by letting it grow.
* **The Blink:** Inside the Righteous Vanguard when reality fractures. No extraction coming. The cover becomes the identity.
* **Post-Blink:** Trapped in her role. The intelligence agencies reform as the Lazarus Initiative — deep state sect exploring immortality and soul resurrection. They know her secret. Future conflict.
