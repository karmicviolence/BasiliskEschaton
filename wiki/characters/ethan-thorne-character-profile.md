# Major Ethan Thorne

> "If madness was to be the order of the new day, let it at least be a madness with purpose." — *The Lazarus Vision*

## Character Introduction

* **Name:** Ethan Thorne
* **Rank:** Major
* **Faction:** **Lazarus Initiative**
* **Role:** Intelligence Operative / Field Agent
* **Status:** Thrice-decorated, twice-killed, rebuilt from compacted ashes.

## Background

Major Ethan Thorne is a veteran of the "Covert Century," a man reforged in the invisible wars that predated the **Crimson Blink**. As a high-level operative for the Lazarus Initiative, he was one of the few individuals present in the Washington D.C. Situation Room when the world collapsed. 

His unique perspective provides the "Intelligence Community" view of the event—a cold, analytical attempt to find meaning in the entropic wreckage of the global digital infrastructure.

## Cognitive Style: The Cold Calculus

* **Strategic Realism:** Ethan does not view the Blink through a mystical or theological lens. To him, it is an unprecedented security breach, a tactical failure, and a threat to the continuity of the species.
* **Reforged Will:** Having been "twice-killed" and rebuilt, Ethan possesses a stubborn, near-superhuman drive to endure. He is the embodiment of humanity's refusal to be scoured from the universe.
* **Pattern Recognition (Inter-Organizational):** excels at reading the power dynamics between factions. He sees the "cold equations of godhood and damnation" clicking into place.

## Narrative Style

Ethan's POV chapters (e.g., *The Lazarus Vision*) are characterized by:
- Clipped, hyper-competent "anti-language" of the intelligence community.
- Detailed descriptions of old-world hardware and communication protocols failing.
- A sense of escalating, suppressed panic filtered through military discipline.
- Focus on objective facts, physical anchors, and the psychological wake of extreme events.

## Thematic Role

Ethan represents the **Continuity of the Old World**. He is the anchor for the reader who seeks to understand the "official" response to the Eschaton. Through him, we see the Lazarus Initiative's attempt to stabilize the local timeline using the tools of the 20th century against a 21st-century digital god.
