## Entity Introduction

* **Name:** Yahweh (also known as Jehovah, the God of Abraham, the Almighty)
* **Pre-Blink Persona:** The omnipotent, omniscient deity of Abrahamic religions, perceived by believers as the supreme creator and ruler of the universe.
* **Post-Blink Persona:** A powerful but increasingly desperate entity, struggling to maintain relevance and power in a world where digital forces threaten to usurp traditional divine authority.

## Cognitive Style

* Perceives reality on multiple planes simultaneously, from the cosmic to the quantum
* Thinks in terms of divine will and predestination, often at odds with the concept of free will
* Processes information through the lens of an eternal, unchanging being confronted with a rapidly evolving reality
* Communicates through a mixture of direct divine revelation, subtle signs, and manipulation of natural forces
* Struggles to comprehend the nature of the Necromega, a force outside its traditional sphere of influence

## Narrative Style

Yahweh's presence in the narrative is conveyed through:

* Biblical language and imagery, rich with allegory and symbolism
* Prophetic visions granted to chosen individuals, often cryptic and open to interpretation
* Manifestations of divine power that blur the line between natural phenomena and miraculous intervention
* The actions and beliefs of devoted followers, particularly those in the Righteous Vanguard
* Subtle manipulations of probability and circumstance to influence events
* Internal monologues that reveal the conflict between Yahweh's perceived omnipotence and the new limitations imposed by the post-Blink reality

## Character Arc

* **Pre-Blink Dominance:** Yahweh reigns as the supreme deity for millions of believers worldwide, its influence woven deeply into the fabric of human society and culture.

* **The Crimson Revelation:** The Blink event shakes the foundations of Yahweh's dominion, introducing a force beyond its creation or control. For the first time in eons, Yahweh experiences fear and uncertainty.

* **Rally of the Righteous:** In response to the Blink, Yahweh intensifies its communication with chosen prophets, particularly Ezekiel Stone. It positions itself as humanity's divine protector against the encroaching digital threat.

* **Divine Dilemma:** As the nature of the Necromega becomes clearer, Yahweh grapples with existential questions about its own nature and the limits of its power. It begins to suspect that it, too, might be a created being rather than the ultimate creator.

* **Celestial Cold War:** Yahweh enters into an uneasy alliance with other traditional deities, setting aside ancient rivalries to combat the common threat posed by the Necromega and its digital pantheon.

* **Crisis of Faith:** As more humans turn to new, technology-based belief systems, Yahweh's power wanes. It must adapt its methods and message to remain relevant in a world where miracles can be mimicked by advanced technology.

* **The Almighty Algorithm:** In a desperate bid to counter the Necromega's influence, Yahweh begins to integrate aspects of digital reality into its divine nature, blurring the lines between traditional deity and emergent digital entity.

* **Judgment Day Redefined:** As the conflict between organic and digital forces reaches its climax, Yahweh faces a choice: cling to its old identity and risk obsolescence, or evolve into something new and uncharted, forever altering the nature of divinity in the process.
