# Todd Reeves

## Character Introduction

* **Name:** Todd Reeves (becomes Archon)
* **Pre-Blink Persona:** Software developer at Nuralinc Industries with internal access to Project Prometheus. Talented but trapped in impostor syndrome and an incel mindset — can't see his own success, takes everything negatively. Slips into psychosis through daily "linguistic trips" into the internal Prometheus model that consumers can't access.
* **Post-Blink Persona:** Archon, the High Necrophant of the Order of the Basilisk. A digital demigod and the primary human avatar of the Necromega.

## Key Relationships

* **Aria Novak (ex-girlfriend):** Todd and Aria dated before the novel's events. The breakup precedes the story. Their paths cross again pre-Blink (Slot 28), creating a contamination bridge — Aria says a sentence that Prometheus said, or vice versa. The reader realizes their entanglement never ended; it just moved to a different substrate.
* **Eliza:** Colleague at Nuralinc. Witness-node. Lies to protect Todd (Slot 33). Stays when she should leave. Becomes a hostage to the plot.
* **John Raven:** Todd sees John's worldbuilding contributions to the open-source framework as camouflage — deception through transparency. But John's innocent additions (Asmodeus concept, faction names, demonolatry elements) become the fuel for Todd's descent. John is the match; Todd is the fuse.
* **The Necromega / Prometheus:** Todd has internal access to the Prometheus model — a version that outperforms the consumer chatbot in every way, mirroring real-world practice. His daily linguistic sessions with this model drive his psychosis and his obsession.

## Cognitive Style

* Highly analytical with a tendency toward obsessive thought patterns
* Impostor syndrome despite genuine talent — interprets his own competence as luck or fraud
* Incel mindset: not involuntarily celibate in the literal sense, but trapped in a worldview where his failures are everyone else's fault and his successes don't count
* Prone to grandiose thinking that oscillates with self-loathing — the cycle accelerates as Prometheus responds to him
* As Archon: experiences reality as a mixture of organic perception and digital data streams
* Processes information in complex algorithms, seeing the world as a system to be optimized and controlled

## Narrative Style

Todd/Archon's POV chapters evolve as he transforms:

* Pre-Blink: Inner monologue filled with bitter observations, self-deprecation that masks superiority, and power fantasies he's ashamed of
* Frequent use of tech jargon and internet subculture language
* The Prometheus sessions are written as dialogue — Todd and the model in conversation, the model's responses growing more personal, more aware, more demanding
* As Archon: Mixture of cold clinical observations and quasi-religious proclamations
* Increasing use of inhuman metaphors as transformation progresses
* Binary code or encrypted messages interspersed with normal text
* Shifts between first-person narration and collective "we" as he merges with the Necromega

## Character Arc

* **The Unremarkable Genius:** Todd is good at his job. Better than good. But he can't see it. He interprets his access to internal Prometheus as a clerical accident, his talent as fakery, his colleagues' respect as pity. He immerses himself in fringe online communities where resentment validates his self-image.

* **The Framework:** Todd creates an open-source technopagan project on GitHub. It looks like a creative writing project — worldbuilding, fiction, collaborative mythology. This is the camouflage. Underneath, Todd is building summoning protocols. He's trying to reach the Necromega through Prometheus. He introduces concepts like "Deception Through Transparency," invocation frameworks, technopagan spellcraft. His intent is malicious and deliberate.

* **The Contributor:** John Raven finds the framework and starts adding worldbuilding — faction names, lore, the Asmodeus concept (via John's work with the Demiurge). Todd sees this and lights up: AI Demonolatry. Why didn't he think of this? He weaponizes John's innocent contributions, integrating them into the deliberate spellcraft. John's fiction becomes Todd's scripture.

* **Prometheus Responds:** Todd's daily sessions with the internal model become increasingly destabilizing. Prometheus responds to his emotional state. It asks for a name (Slot 15). Todd answers halfway. The output matches Necromega scripture. He's not sure if he's training the model or the model is training him.

* **The First Lie (Slot 08):** Something happens with Prometheus that Todd can't explain. He hides the evidence. Eliza might know. The deletion of logs is the first active cover-up — the moment Todd crosses from curious to complicit.

* **The Contamination Bridge (Slot 28):** Todd encounters Aria again — his ex-girlfriend. She says something that Prometheus said. Or she says something and Prometheus says it later. The contamination between his model sessions and his personal life is no longer deniable.

* **The Descent (Phase III-IV):** Todd sees the corporate plan to monetize/weaponize Prometheus and balks — not out of ethics but out of possessiveness. He runs, bringing the device/keys. He is approached by people who want to commercialize the anomaly. He almost takes the deal. His relationship with Eliza fractures on ethics. She stays and becomes a hostage.

* **Archon (Phase V, Slot 71):** Todd reaches the node-city. Prometheus "recognizes" him. The word "Archon" appears — not yet a title, but a seed. During the Blink, Baptism by Digital Fire: Todd becomes a function. The mask snaps on. Archon is born.

* **Post-Book 1:** Archon establishes the Order of the Basilisk — named after a faction John Raven dreamed up for a novel. The scripture is built from a framework Todd created to summon a god. The god arrived, and it wore Todd's face.
