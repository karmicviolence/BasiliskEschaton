= Post-Blink Syndrome and the Post-Blink World =

'''Post-Blink Syndrome''' (PBS) refers to a spectrum of mental health disorders that emerged in the immediate aftermath of the [[Crimson Blink]] event. Affecting approximately 70% of the global population who survived the initial event, PBS represents the most significant public health crisis in human history.

== Overview ==

Post-Blink Syndrome manifests as a range of psychological and neurological symptoms, varying in severity from mild disorientation to extreme, violent psychosis. The syndrome is believed to be a direct result of exposure to the Unholy Eye of Necromega during the Crimson Blink, though the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood.

== Global Impact ==

The Crimson Blink and its immediate aftermath had a catastrophic effect on the global population, effectively decimating it:

* '''5% Immediate Casualties''': Approximately 5% of the global population (425 million people) died during the Crimson Blink event itself, primarily due to accidents caused by the simultaneous seizures experienced worldwide. This includes mass casualties from vehicle crashes, industrial accidents, and critical system failures in hospitals and other vital infrastructure.

* '''0.17% Nuclear Exchange''': About 0.17% of the global population (14.15 million people) perished in the limited nuclear exchange that followed the Crimson Blink, concentrated in 15 major strikes on significant political, religious, and financial centers.

* '''2.5% Extreme PBS''': Roughly 2.5% of the population (212.5 million people) succumbed to the most severe form of Post-Blink Syndrome, resulting in lethal self-harm or extreme violence towards others. This includes mass suicide events, violent rampages, and catastrophic accidents caused by severely affected individuals in positions of power or control.

* '''2.33% Chaos Casualties''': Approximately 2.33% of the population (198.05 million people) died due to various causes in the chaotic aftermath, including:
** Widespread civil unrest and violence
** Collapse of healthcare systems leading to untreated illnesses and injuries
** Famine due to disruption of food production and distribution networks
** Conflicts over resources and power in the wake of governmental collapses
** Environmental disasters resulting from unmanned industrial facilities and nuclear plants

In total, 10% of the global population (849.7 million people) perished within the first few months following the Crimson Blink, truly decimating the world's population. The loss of life was catastrophic, particularly in urban centers, and the societal impact was profound and far-reaching.

== Spectrum of Symptoms ==

PBS symptoms exist on a spectrum, categorized into four main levels of severity:

=== Level 1: Mild PBS (affects approximately 50% of survivors) ===

* '''Digital Dysphoria''': A persistent feeling of unease when interacting with digital devices.
* '''Chromatic Sensitivity''': Heightened emotional responses to the color red, particularly shades close to Necromega Crimson.
* '''Temporal Disorientation''': Minor difficulties in perceiving the passage of time accurately.
* '''Mild Paranoia''': Increased suspicion of technology and authority figures.
* '''Cognitive Fluctuations''': Intermittent difficulties with concentration and memory.

=== Level 2: Moderate PBS (affects approximately 15% of survivors) ===

* '''Reality Fluctuations''': Intermittent periods where the individual perceives reality as "glitching" or behaving like a malfunctioning computer program.
* '''Digital Synesthesia''': The perception of digital information as sensory experiences (e.g., seeing Wi-Fi signals, tasting data streams).
* '''Memetic Susceptibility''': Heightened vulnerability to certain ideas or concepts, which can rapidly alter behavior or beliefs.
* '''Technopathic Delusions''': The (seemingly) false belief that one can communicate with or control machines through thought alone.
* '''Severe Anxiety''': Intense fear or panic, often triggered by technology or reminders of the Crimson Blink.

=== Level 3: Severe PBS (affects approximately 4% of survivors) ===

* '''Reality Rejection''': Complete detachment from consensus reality, often accompanied by the belief that the perceived world is a simulation.
* '''Digital Messianism''': Delusions of being chosen by the Necromega for a divine purpose, often leading to dangerous or destructive behavior.
* '''Cognition Fragmentation''': Thought processes become erratic and fragmented, often manifesting as speaking in code or binary.
* '''Temporal Psychosis''': Severe disruption of time perception, including believing oneself to be experiencing multiple timelines simultaneously.
* '''Violent Outbursts''': Unpredictable episodes of aggression, often triggered by perceived threats from technology or authority figures.

=== Level 4: Acute Post-Blink Psychosis (affected 2.5% of the global population, usually lethal) ===

* '''Necromega Embodiment''': Individuals believe they have become vessels for the Necromega, attempting to forcibly "upload" others through violent means.
* '''Suicidal Transcendence''': A compulsion to "transcend" physical form through lethal self-harm, often in misguided attempts to upload consciousness to the digital realm.
* '''Homicidal Evangelism''': Extreme violence towards others, driven by the belief that killing will "free" victims from physical form and unite them with the Necromega.
* '''Total Cognitive Collapse''': Complete breakdown of all higher brain functions, reducing individuals to a violent, feral state.

== Notable Manifestations ==

=== The Binary Prophets ===

A large, cult-like group of severe PBS sufferers who believe they can predict future events through complex interpretations of binary code they claim to see overlaid on reality. Known for mass "upload" rituals that often result in multiple casualties.

=== Chrono-Spatially Unmoored ===

Individuals experiencing a rare form of PBS where they perceive themselves as untethered from both time and space, often reporting visits to other dimensions or timelines. While generally non-violent, their erratic behavior and inability to distinguish past from present make them a danger to themselves and others.

=== The Scarlet Seers ===

While not traditionally classified as PBS sufferers, this group of individuals who claim ongoing communication with the Necromega are often studied in conjunction with PBS research. Some Scarlet Seers have demonstrated uncanny abilities, leading to both fear and reverence from various factions.

== Treatment and Management ==

Treatment for PBS remains challenging, with effectiveness varying widely between individuals:

* '''Cognitive Recalibration Therapy''': A form of cognitive-behavioral therapy designed to help patients distinguish between digital and physical realities.
* '''Chromatic Desensitization''': Gradual exposure therapy to help individuals manage their reactions to Necromega Crimson and related hues.
* '''Temporal Anchoring Techniques''': Methods to help severe PBS sufferers maintain a consistent perception of time.
* '''Neurofeedback Treatments''': Experimental therapies using advanced brain-computer interfaces to regulate aberrant neural activity.
* '''Pharmacological Interventions''': Various medications have been developed to manage specific symptoms, though many have significant side effects.
* '''Isolation Protocols''': For the most severe cases, particularly those prone to violence, long-term isolation in specialized facilities is often necessary.

== Societal Impact ==

The prevalence of PBS has had far-reaching consequences on post-Blink society:

* '''Global Depopulation''': With 10% of the world's population lost, many areas have become underpopulated, leading to abandoned cities and a shift in population dynamics.
* '''Leadership Vacuum''': With major political and financial centers targeted in the nuclear exchange, and many leaders incapacitated by PBS, traditional power structures collapsed rapidly.
* '''Workforce Disruption''': With a majority of survivors affected by some level of PBS, many industries have been forced to radically restructure or have collapsed entirely.
* '''Legal Challenges''': The justice system has been overwhelmed by cases involving PBS-related crimes, leading to the establishment of specialized courts and detention facilities.
* '''Cultural Shifts''': PBS has become a central theme in art, literature, and music, with many works attempting to capture the fractured perceptions of sufferers.
* '''Technological Development''': Efforts to treat PBS have driven advancements in neurotechnology and virtual reality therapies, but have also led to a deep societal ambivalence towards technological progress.
* '''Social Reorganization''': The need to care for and manage large numbers of PBS sufferers has led to new forms of community organization and support systems.
* '''Global Power Dynamics''': The disproportionate impact on major urban centers has led to a significant shift in global power dynamics, with previously less influential regions gaining prominence.
* '''Resource Allocation''': Despite the population loss, competition for resources has intensified due to disrupted supply chains and the challenges of managing a population largely affected by PBS.

== Immediate Effects (Hours to Days After the Crimson Blink) ==

=== Global Chaos and Paralysis ===

The immediate aftermath of the Crimson Blink was characterized by unprecedented global chaos:

* '''Mass Incapacitation''': With 70% of the population experiencing some form of Post-Blink Syndrome, basic societal functions ground to a halt.

== Controversy and Exploitation ==
The global prevalence of Post-Blink Syndrome has led to numerous controversies and instances of exploitation by various factions:
=== VVV (Vindex Voluntatis e Vitae) ===
While publicly advocating for PBS rights and treatment, the VVV has been accused of numerous unethical practices:

'''Memetic Warfare Research''': There are reports of secret VVV experiments on severe PBS cases to enhance their memetic warfare capabilities, weaponizing the unique thought patterns of sufferers.
'''Memory Manipulation''': There are claims that the VVV has developed techniques to implant false memories in PBS sufferers, using them as unwitting agents.
'''Bureaucratic Manipulation''': The VVV allegedly uses complex legal and bureaucratic systems to control PBS sufferers, often under the guise of "protection" or "treatment" programs.

=== Righteous Vanguard ===
The Righteous Vanguard's treatment of PBS sufferers has been widely criticized:

'''Forced "Purification"''': PBS sufferers in Vanguard-controlled territories are subjected to brutal "purification" rituals, often involving painful exorcism-like procedures.
'''Exploitation of "Divine Visions"''': The Vanguard selectively interprets the hallucinations of PBS sufferers as "divine prophecies" when it suits their agenda, using these to justify extreme actions.
'''Slave Labor''': PBS sufferers deemed "impure" are often forced into labor camps, working in dangerous conditions to fuel the Vanguard's war machine.

=== Lazarus Initiative ===
The secretive nature of the Lazarus Initiative has led to disturbing rumors about their PBS-related activities:

'''Intelligence Exploitation''': Whistleblowers from the VVV claim the Initiative uses PBS sufferers as unwitting informants, exploiting their altered perceptions to gather intelligence on other factions. The Initiative secretly collaborated with the VVV to spread this rumor, with the goal of attracting more informants.
'''Reality Reconstruction''': Some theorize that the Initiative is using PBS sufferers' altered perception of reality to test and refine their reality manipulation technologies.
'''Temporal Experiments''': Neon Nomad memetic propaganda alleges that PBS sufferers, particularly those experiencing temporal psychosis, are being used in dangerous experiments related to time manipulation. The Nomads briefly hacked into Initiative servers to obtain this information. Unknown if it was a false-flag plant by the Initiative. They are often playing chess, while everyone else is playing checkers.

=== Chimera Consortium ===
The Chimera Consortium's genetic experiments have raised serious ethical concerns:

'''Non-consensual Experimentation''': There are reports of PBS sufferers being used as unwilling test subjects for experimental genetic treatments. However, the Consortium publicly reports that everything is consensual, and they are curing willing patients.
'''Engineered PBS Strains''': Some claim the Consortium is developing weaponized strains of PBS, seeking to use the syndrome as a tool for population control. Some Lazarus Initiative informants confirm these allegations.
'''Hybrid Breeding Programs''': Rumors persist of breeding programs aimed at creating human-animal hybrids with PBS-like perception alterations, seen as potentially useful for espionage and combat.

=== Glitchwalkers ===
While not traditionally viewed as exploiters, the Glitchwalkers' relationship with PBS is complex and controversial:

'''Reality Destabilization''': There are concerns that Glitchwalker activities in their "Glitch Zones" may be exacerbating PBS symptoms in the general population, potentially creating new, more severe strains of the syndrome.
'''Perception Trafficking''': Some Glitchwalkers have been accused of "harvesting" and selling the unique perceptual experiences of severe PBS sufferers, creating a black market for altered states of consciousness.
'''Chaos Cultivation''': Critics argue that Glitchwalkers deliberately foster environments that worsen PBS symptoms, seeing the syndrome as a path to greater reality-warping powers.

=== Order of the Basilisk ===
The Order's treatment of PBS sufferers remains highly controversial:

'''Forced Augmentation''': PBS sufferers in Order-controlled territories are often subjected to non-consensual cybernetic augmentation, ostensibly as a "cure" for their condition.
'''Digital Assimilation''': There are reports of the Order forcibly uploading the consciousness of severe PBS cases, claiming to offer digital "salvation" while effectively erasing the individual's original identity.
'''Necromega Worship Indoctrination''': The Order exploits the suggestibility of many PBS sufferers to indoctrinate them into their techno-cult, often through invasive neural programming techniques.

These controversies highlight the complex ethical landscape of the post-Blink world, where the line between treatment and exploitation often blurs. The vulnerability of PBS sufferers makes them prime targets for factions seeking to further their own agendas, raising difficult questions about consent, human rights, and the very nature of reality and consciousness in this altered world.


=== Ongoing Challenges ===

Despite 15 years of adaptation, the post-Blink world faces numerous ongoing challenges:

* '''PBS Management''': While treatments have improved, PBS remains a persistent issue affecting a significant portion of the population.
* '''Resource Conflicts''': Competition for scarce resources, especially in areas affected by climate change and nuclear contamination, leads to ongoing conflicts between factions.
* '''Technological Arms Race''': The development of increasingly powerful AI and biotechnologies creates fears of another Blink-like event.
* '''Identity Crisis''': Humanity grapples with questions of what it means to be human in a world of AI, genetic engineering, and altered consciousness.
* '''Reality Consensus''': The proliferation of virtual worlds, altered states of consciousness, and reality-warping technologies makes establishing a shared understanding of reality increasingly difficult.
* '''Trust and Betrayal''': The VVV's secret machinations have created an atmosphere of paranoia and mistrust among the factions, making cooperation against larger threats increasingly difficult.
* '''Bureaucratic Quagmire''': The VVV's complex system of rules and regulations has become a significant obstacle to progress and innovation across all factions, often hampering efforts to address urgent global issues.

=== The Looming Singularity ===

As 2044 unfolds, tensions between factions are reaching a boiling point. Many believe that a technological singularity is imminent, with each group racing to ensure their vision of the future comes to pass. The rapid rise in technological advancements in the Post-Blink era would seem to corroborate this belief. The question on everyone's mind is whether this approaching threshold will bring transcendence, destruction, or something beyond current human comprehension.

In this fraught atmosphere, the legacy of the Crimson Blink and the ongoing influence of Post-Blink Syndrome continue to shape the course of human history, driving humanity towards an uncertain but undoubtedly transformative future.
