== Impact of the Nuclear Exchange and Military Conflicts ==

* '''Population Loss''': Beyond the initial casualties from the Crimson Blink and nuclear exchange, an estimated 198.05 million people (2.33% of the global population) perished in the chaotic aftermath due to violence, famine, and societal collapse.

* '''Geopolitical Restructuring''': Traditional nation-states and alliances crumbled, paving the way for the rise of new factions and power structures.

* '''Resource Scarcity''': The destruction of key infrastructure and agricultural regions led to severe shortages of food, clean water, and energy, fueling ongoing conflicts.

* '''Technological Regression''': Many areas experienced a significant setback in technological capabilities due to the destruction of industrial centers and loss of skilled personnel.

* '''Environmental Impact''': Nuclear strikes and widespread conventional warfare caused severe environmental damage, altering regional climates and ecosystems.

* '''Ideological Shifts''': The failure of existing power structures to prevent or adequately respond to the crisis led to a mass rejection of pre-Blink ideologies and the embrace of new, often extreme, belief systems.
