== "Holy Magic" and Human Potential ==

The Righteous Vanguard rejects modern technology, instead focusing on what they call "holy magic" - a mix of ancient religious practices and advanced understanding of human biology. Their scientists and spiritual leaders work together to unlock the hidden potential of the human body and mind.

These practices represent the Righteous Vanguard's attempt to reach the peak of human potential without using modern technology. They believe this approach combines true faith with God's gift of human intellect. However, critics warn that many of these techniques could be used to manipulate people and argue that they're not truly supernatural.

The Vanguard sees this work as a holy mission, believing that unlocking the full power of the human body and mind is the path to spiritual enlightenment. They view their "holy magic" as proof of humanity's divine nature and use it to further their cause in the post-Blink world.
