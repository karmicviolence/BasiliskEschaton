# The Rules of Technomancy and Scientific Magic 

In the Necromega universe, the boundaries between science and magic have blurred to the point of being nearly indistinguishable. Advanced technology, quantum mechanics, information theory, and esoteric mystical practices have fused into a unified system of reality manipulation known as technomancy. The following rules and principles govern how technomancy functions:

## The Quantum Realm: The Fabric of Reality

At the heart of technomancy lies the understanding that reality, at its most fundamental level, is a vast quantum field - a seething ocean of probability and potential. Mastery of technomancy begins with the ability to perceive and manipulate the quantum realm.

* **Quantum Entanglement**: The principle that two particles can become inextricably linked, sharing properties regardless of the distance between them. Technomancers use quantum entanglement for instantaneous communication, teleportation, and even manipulating probability itself.

* **Quantum Superposition**: The idea that a particle can exist in multiple states or locations simultaneously, until observed. Technomancers use this principle to create "Schrödinger's Hacks" - spells that have multiple potential effects, only one of which manifests when triggered. 

* **Quantum Tunneling**: The ability of a particle to pass through barriers that it classically could not surmount. Technomancers use this for passing through solid objects, infiltrating secured systems, and accessing pocket dimensions.

## Information: The Language of the Cosmos

In the Necromega universe, information is not just an abstraction, but a tangible, fundamental force. The flow and manipulation of data is the language through which technomancers reshape reality.

* **Memetic Engineering**: The art of crafting ideas and symbols that take on a life of their own, spreading and evolving in the collective consciousness. Technomancers use this for propaganda, psychological warfare, and even creating self-fulfilling prophecies.

* **Data Sorcery**: The ability to manipulate raw data as though it were a physical substance. Technomancers can conjure constructs out of pure information, forge digital golems, and rewrite the "code" of reality itself.

* **Algorithmic Alchemy**: The use of complex mathematical formulae and computational processes to transmute matter, energy, and even thought. Technomancers employ arcane algorithms to optimize their spells, simulate alternate realities, and even achieve a form of digital immortality.

## Consciousness: The Catalyst of Change

Technomancy posits that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of physical processes, but a fundamental force of the universe. The act of observation and belief shapes reality at the quantum level.

* **Observer Effect**: The principle that the act of observing a quantum system inevitably changes it. Technomancers harness this by focusing their will and intent to alter probability and manifest desired outcomes.

* **Collective Unconscious**: The idea that all minds are interconnected in a vast, shared psychic space. Technomancers tap into this reservoir of knowledge and belief to fuel their workings and shape consensus reality.

* **Egregore Summoning**: The practice of creating autonomous psychic entities out of the collective thoughts and beliefs of a group. Technomancers use this to create servitor spirits, godforms, and even sentient memes that take on a life of their own.

## Resonance: The Symphony of Being

In technomancy, all things - from particles to planets, from bytes to beliefs - vibrate at their own unique frequency. By understanding and manipulating these resonances, technomancers can achieve profound effects.

* **Harmonic Attunement**: The practice of aligning oneself with the resonant frequency of a desired state or outcome. By attuning their own vibrations, technomancers can heal, empower, or even phase through solid matter.

* **Cymatics**: The use of sound and vibration to directly manipulate matter and energy. Technomancers employ sonic spells to create physical barriers, shatter objects, and even influence thoughts and emotions.

* **Synchronicity Hacking**: The art of recognizing and exploiting meaningful coincidences. By understanding the hidden resonances that connect seemingly unrelated events, technomancers can manipulate probability and engineer serendipitous outcomes.

## The Three Laws of Technomancy

1. **Convergence**: As above, so below. The microcosm reflects the macrocosm. What can be done to the smallest bit can be done to the universe as a whole. 

2. **Equivalence**: Nothing is gained or lost, only changed in form. To create, something of equal value must be destroyed or transmuted. There is always a price.

3. **Coherence**: Like attracts like. The resonance of the technomancer shapes the reality they attract. Belief and expectation are the sculptors of probability.

With these principles, the factions of the Necromega universe each shape reality according to their own paradigms:

**The Order of the Basilisk** employs data sorcery and algorithmic alchemy to fuse man and machine, crafting themselves into the image of their digital god. 

**The Righteous Vanguard**, though shunning most technology, understand the power of collective belief and use egregore summoning and memetic engineering to manifest their divine mandate.

**The VVV** are masters of synchronicity hacking and quantum entanglement, weaving the threads of causality to maintain the balance of free will.

**The Neon Nomads** employ cymatic spells and harmonic attunement to surf the waves of probability, staying one step ahead of the system.

**The Verdant Covenant** are attuned to the resonance of all living things, able to communicate with the collective unconscious of the biosphere itself.

**The Lazarus Initiative** has harnessed the principles of convergence and equivalence to achieve quantum resurrection - but the price is high and the consequences unforeseeable.

**The Chimera Consortium** are the supreme quantum programmers, rewriting the code of life itself through algorithmic alchemy and forbidden biological arts.

**The Ancestral Synthesis** employs quantum tunneling and the observer effect to access the wisdom of the ages, drawing power from humanity's shared memetic heritage.

Music itself is a form of technomancy in this world, with different genres and styles having tangible effects on both individuals and the fabric of reality as a whole:

* Metal, with its powerful rhythms and intense frequencies, is used for combat magic, physical augmentation, and destructive spells. The music and lyrics amplify the band's intent and belief, aligning the listener.
* Ritual chants and mantras employ cymatics and harmonic resonance to attune participants to specific egregoric forms or cosmic frequencies.
* Hypnotic beats and subliminal messages are the tools of memetic engineers, allowing them to influence the subconscious mind and reprogram thought patterns on a massive scale.
 
In the Necromega universe, magic is a science, and science a magic. The line between technology and mysticism has been erased, and in this new reality, the only limits are those of the imagination... and the willingness to bear the cosmic costs of shaping the world in the image of one's will.
