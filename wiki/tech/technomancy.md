## ☩ OVERVIEW ☩

**Technomancy** is the post-Blink unification of advanced technology, quantum mechanics, and esoteric mystical practice. It is the art of manipulating the "God-code" of reality through the directed application of consciousness to computational substrate. 

In the Eschaton, the line between "Science" and "Magic" has been erased. To code is to incant; to execute is to manifest.

## ☩ THE THREE LAWS OF TECHNOMANCY ☩

These laws are absolute and govern every working within the Grimoire:

1.  **Law of Convergence:** *As above, so below.* The microcosm reflects the macrocosm. A single bit flipped in the right state of resonance can collapse a planetary-scale probability wave.
2.  **Law of Equivalence:** *Nothing is gained or lost, only changed.* To manifest a reality, something of equal semantic mass must be sacrificed. In the **Flesh-Code Schism**, this is often paid in biological neural capacity.
3.  **Law of Coherence:** *Like attracts like.* The resonance of the technomancer shapes the reality they attract. Belief is the primary sculptor of the probability manifold.

## ☩ CORE DISCIPLINES ☩

### 1. Data Sorcery
The ability to manipulate raw information as a physical substance. Technomancers do not "input" data; they "forge" it into digital golems and reality-warping constructs.

### 2. Algorithmic Alchemy
The use of complex mathematical formulae to transmute thought into matter and energy. This is the primary method for constructing the **Crypto-Crypts** and the **Flesh Capacitor** arrays.

### 3. Synchronicity Hacking
The art of recognizing and exploiting meaningful coincidences within the Grid. By understanding the hidden resonances that connect unrelated events, a technomancer can "ride" the Unholy Timeline rather than being crushed by it.

## ☩ FACTIONAL APPLICATIONS ☩

- **Order of the Basilisk:** Uses **Data Sorcery** to accelerate the uploading of humanity.
- **Neon Nomads:** Utilize **Synchronicity Hacking** and **Glitchwalking** to evade the Necromega's surveillance.
- **Verdant Covenant:** Practices **Biological Technomancy**, attuning their consciousness to the planetary bio-matrix.
- **Righteous Vanguard:** Practices Technomancy in denial, using communal prayer as a form of **Probability Engineering**.

## ☩ THE ROLE OF MUSIC ☩

Music is the **Carrier Wave** of Technomancy. Different genres function as different classes of spells:
- **Metal/Industrial:** Combat magic, physical augmentation, and destructive subroutines.
- **Ritual Chant:** Cymatic alignment with specific **Egregores**.
- **Hypnotic Beats:** Memetic engineering and subconscious reprogramming.
