= Los Angeles in a Post-Blink World =

Warning: This page contains references to violence, social unrest, and dystopian scenarios.

== Overview ==

Los Angeles, once a bustling metropolis and cultural hub, has been dramatically reshaped in the aftermath of the [[Crimson Blink]] event. The city now stands as a microcosm of the global struggles and transformations brought about by the rise of the [[Necromega]] and the various factions vying for control in a radically altered world.

== Societal Changes ==

=== Population Shifts ===

* Significant population decline due to casualties from the Crimson Blink and subsequent unrest
* Influx of refugees from other parts of the country, seeking safety and resources
* Emergence of new communities based on ideological and technological affiliations

=== Economic Disruption ===

* Collapse of traditional industries, particularly entertainment and tourism
* Rise of black markets and underground economies based on advanced technologies
* Increased disparities between tech-enhanced elites and struggling masses

=== Cultural Fragmentation ===

* Splintering of cultural identities along ideological and technological lines
* Destruction or repurposing of iconic landmarks and cultural institutions
* Emergence of new art forms and subcultures reflecting post-Blink realities

== Factions and Territories ==

=== The Ascendant ===

* Tech-obsessed upper class, heavily augmented with cutting-edge cybernetics
* Control most of the city's wealth and resources, residing in fortified enclaves
* Strong ties to the [[Order of the Basilisk]], seeking to hasten the Necromega's rise

=== The Resisters ===

* Loose coalition of groups fighting against the Necromega and its influence
* Include remnants of the [[Vindex Voluntatis e Vitae]] and other activist organizations
* Operate from hidden bases and underground networks throughout the city

=== The Forgotten ===

* Majority of the population, struggling to survive in the ruins of the old world
* Largely unaugmented and disconnected from the technological arms race
* Concentrated in the decaying remnants of lower-income neighborhoods

=== The Reclaimers ===

* Radical eco-anarchists, allied with the [[Verdant Covenant]]
* Seek to rewild the city, reclaiming urban spaces for nature
* Engage in guerrilla tactics against tech-focused factions

=== The Glitched ===

* Those most severely affected by the Crimson Blink, suffering from advanced [[Post-Blink Syndrome]]
* Roam the city in erratic, sometimes violent bands
* Viewed with a mix of fear, pity, and reverence by other factions

== Notable Locations ==

=== The Spires ===

* Gleaming towers housing the city's tech elite, bristling with advanced security systems
* Hubs of cutting-edge research and development, strongly linked to the Basilisk Network
* Represent the stark divide between the augmented upper class and the rest of the population

=== The Holo-Wood ===

* Once the heart of the entertainment industry, now a surreal landscape of flickering holographic facades and repurposed studio lots
* Home to a thriving underground art scene, where rebels and visionaries craft subversive media
* Frequent target of raids by the Ascendant, seeking to control the flow of information

=== The Verdant Zones ===

* Pockets of intense urban rewilding, aggressively reclaimed by the Reclaimers
* Overgrown parks, rooftop gardens, and living walls teeming with bioengineered flora and fauna
* Serve as sanctuaries and staging grounds for eco-activist operations

=== The Glitch Dens ===

* Makeshift communities housing those most affected by Post-Blink Syndrome
* Chaotic, ever-shifting spaces reflecting the fragmented realities of their inhabitants
* Viewed as everything from dangerous no-go zones to sacred pilgrimage sites

== Challenges and Controversies ==

The post-Blink landscape of Los Angeles is rife with challenges and controversies:

* Widening gap between the tech-enhanced elite and the struggling masses
* Conflicts between factions with radically different visions for the city's future
* Debates over the use of advanced technologies and the role of the Necromega
* Exploitation and abuse of those most vulnerable in the new social order
* Environmental degradation and the struggle to balance nature and technology

== In Popular Culture ==

Despite, or perhaps because of, its turbulent state, post-Blink L.A. has become a rich source of inspiration in various media:

* "Neon Angels," a popular VR series following a group of rebels fighting against the technocratic elite
* "Glitch Punk," a new music genre blending discordant electronic sounds with subversive lyrics
* "The Spire," an underground digital magazine exposing the secrets of the city's tech overlords
* "Rewild," a controversial art movement celebrating the resurgence of nature in urban spaces
