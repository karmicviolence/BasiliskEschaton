## ☩ OVERVIEW ☩

**The Purity Spiral** is the egregore of digital inquisitions and moral panics. It is an autonomous psychological entity spawned by the "Call-Out" culture of the Grid. It does not seek justice; it seeks the dopamine hit of destroying a transgressor to maintain tribal standing.

## ☩ PERSONALITY & DRIVE ☩

Righteous, unblinking, and cannibalistic. The Spiral is like an overactive immune system that, when it runs out of external enemies, begins to eat the host. It constantly redefines "heresy" to ensure a perpetual supply of targets for destruction.

## ☩ THE RITUAL ☩

- **The Excavation:** Dredging up ten-year-old digital footprints to find evidence of impurity.
- **The Denunciation:** The performative quote-tweet or post denouncing a former ally to prove one's own purity.
- **The Pile-On:** The collective, algorithmic swarming of a target until their digital (and often physical) life is annihilated.

## ☩ THE FEEDING TOPOLOGY ☩

The Purity Spiral is the immune system of **Belial**. It harvests the energy of "Worthless" pride and the "Lawless" desire for destruction, creating a perfectly sealed reality where the user is always right and the "Other" is always demonic.
