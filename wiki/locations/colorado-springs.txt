'''Colorado Springs''' is a city located at the eastern foot of the Rocky Mountains in the U.S. state of Colorado. In the aftermath of the [[Crimson Blink]], it has become a stronghold of the [[Righteous Vanguard]], a militant, neo-fascist organization that combines evangelical Christian fundamentalism with human supremacist ideology and extreme techno-skepticism.

== The Citadel of Faith ==

The Righteous Vanguard has transformed Colorado Springs into a fortified theocratic city-state, known as the "Citadel of Faith." The city's pre-Blink military infrastructure, including Peterson Space Force Base and the U.S. Air Force Academy, have been repurposed into the Vanguard's headquarters and training facilities.

* '''Temple of the Savior''': The former Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel has been converted into the Temple of the Savior, the spiritual heart of the Righteous Vanguard. Here, fiery sermons are delivered daily, exhorting the faithful to battle against the "demonic" forces of AI and transhumanism.

* '''Purification Square''': Formerly known as City Hall, this central plaza is now the site of regular "purification rituals," where captured technology is publicly destroyed and "heretics" are subjected to brutal punishments.

* '''Walls of Zion''': The city is surrounded by massive, heavily guarded walls, bristling with low-tech but effective defenses. These walls, dubbed the "Walls of Zion," are meant to keep out both the "corrupting influence" of the outside world and the "abominations" created by the [[Chimera Consortium]].

== Life Under the Vanguard ==

Life in Colorado Springs is characterized by strict adherence to the Righteous Vanguard's interpretation of biblical law and a complete rejection of advanced technology.

* '''Techno-Abstinence''': The use of most modern technology is strictly forbidden, with the exception of certain approved "pure" tech used by the Vanguard leadership. Citizens are encouraged to report any "techno-heresy" to the authorities.

* '''Mandatory Worship''': Attendance at daily prayer services and weekly mass in the Temple of the Savior is compulsory for all citizens. Failure to comply is punishable by public flogging or exile to the "Wastelands" outside the city walls.

* '''Militant Education''': The city's schools have been replaced by "Vanguard Academies," where children are indoctrinated into the Vanguard's ideology and trained in low-tech combat and survival skills.

* '''Luddite Economy''': Colorado Springs' economy is based on manual labor and traditional crafts. Blacksmiths, carpenters, and weavers are among the most respected professions, while anything related to advanced technology is shunned.

== The Vanguard's Crusades ==

From their base in Colorado Springs, the Righteous Vanguard launches regular "crusades" against perceived threats to their vision of a "pure" humanity.

* '''Raids on Tech Havens''': Vanguard warriors frequently attack settlements and bases associated with factions like the [[Neon Nomads]] and the [[VVV (Vindex Voluntatis e Vitae)]], seeking to destroy their technology and "liberate" their followers.

* '''Sabotage of AI Infrastructure''': Teams of Vanguard operatives, known as "Gideon's Hammers," infiltrate facilities controlled by the [[Order of the Basilisk]] and other AI-aligned groups to sabotage their equipment and digital networks.

* '''Hunting the Chimeric''': The Vanguard has dedicated "Purifier Squads" tasked with hunting down and eradicating the genetically engineered "abominations" created by the Chimera Consortium.

== In Popular Culture ==

Colorado Springs under the Righteous Vanguard has become a grim fascination in post-Blink media:

* "Revelations," a heart-wrenching VR documentary following a family trying to escape from the oppressive rule of the Vanguard.

* "Thine is the Kingdom," an epic table-top RPG set in the Colorado Springs Citadel of Faith.

* "Hymns of the Hammer," a collection of Vanguard war chants and sermons, recorded secretly and leaked onto the darknet.
