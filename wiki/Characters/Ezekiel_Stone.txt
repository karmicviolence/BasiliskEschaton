== Ezekiel Stone ==

'''Ezekiel Stone''' is the charismatic and controversial leader of the [[Righteous Vanguard]], a militant neo-fascist organization that emerged in the aftermath of the [[Crimson Blink]]. Known for his fiery sermons and uncompromising stance against technological progress, Stone has become a polarizing figure in the post-Blink world.

=== Background ===

Born in 1985 in a small town in rural Texas, Ezekiel Stone grew up in a deeply religious household. His father, Reverend Jebediah Stone, was a Baptist preacher known for his fire-and-brimstone sermons and conservative political activism. Young Ezekiel was steeped in a fundamentalist interpretation of Christianity from an early age, attending his father's church and a strict Christian school.

As a teenager, Ezekiel became increasingly involved in his father's political activities, attending rallies and protests against what they saw as the moral decay of American society. It was during this time that Ezekiel first encountered the writings of conservative thinkers and conspiracy theorists that would later influence his worldview.

Despite his religious upbringing, Stone initially pursued a career in the military, joining the United States Army at the age of 18 in 2003. This decision was partly influenced by the patriotic fervor following the September 11, 2001 attacks and the subsequent War on Terror.

During his military service, Stone saw combat in several conflicts, including tours in Afghanistan (2004-2005) and Iraq (2007-2008). It was during these experiences that he began to develop his own unique blend of religious fervor and militant ideology. Stone's commanding officers noted his natural charisma and leadership abilities, but also expressed concern about his increasingly extreme religious views and his tendency to proselytize to fellow soldiers.

In 2015, Stone left the military and became a chaplain, using his position to spread his message of "righteous resistance" against what he saw as the moral decay of modern society. His sermons, which blended biblical prophecy with conspiracy theories about government overreach and technological control, began to attract a growing following.

=== Pre-Blink Influences ===

Several key events and movements in the years leading up to the Crimson Blink had a significant impact on Ezekiel Stone's ideological development:

* '''Tea Party Movement (2009-2015)''': Stone was an early supporter of the Tea Party, attracted by its message of limited government and traditional values. He attended numerous rallies and began to build a network of like-minded individuals.

* '''Snowden Revelations (2013)''': The exposure of widespread government surveillance programs deeply affected Stone, reinforcing his distrust of technology and big government. He began incorporating warnings about digital privacy and "deep state" control into his sermons.

* '''Rise of ISIS (2014-2019)''': The emergence of the Islamic State and its use of social media for propaganda fueled Stone's belief in the dangerous potential of technology when combined with extremist ideology. He saw parallels between ISIS and what he perceived as the moral corruption of Western society.

* '''Charlottesville Unite the Right Rally (2017)''': While Stone did not attend the rally, the ensuing controversy and violence led him to develop more explicit white nationalist views, which he began to intertwine with his religious teachings.

* '''COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2023)''': Stone was a vocal opponent of lockdown measures and vaccination programs, seeing them as government overreach and a precursor to more invasive control. He organized several anti-lockdown protests and began to attract a larger following among those who felt disenfranchised by the pandemic response.

* '''AI Advancements and Debates (2022-2028)''': As artificial intelligence became more advanced and integrated into daily life, Stone became one of its most outspoken critics. He warned of the "soulless nature" of AI and its potential to replace human workers and decision-makers, framing it as a threat to humanity's God-given free will.

* '''Quantum Computing Breakthroughs (2025-2028)''': Major advancements in quantum computing, particularly in cryptography and simulation, led Stone to warn of an impending "techno-apocalypse" where machines would gain the power to "play God" by manipulating reality itself.

* '''Climate Change Disasters (2026-2028)''': A series of devastating climate-related disasters, including major hurricanes and wildfires, were interpreted by Stone as divine punishment for humanity's embrace of technology and departure from traditional values.

During this period, Stone's following grew significantly. He established a mega-church in Colorado Springs in 2024, which would later become the foundation for the Citadel of Faith. His weekly online sermons, titled "Prophecies for the Digital Age," gained millions of viewers worldwide.

By 2028, just before the Crimson Blink, Ezekiel Stone had positioned himself as a leading voice in a growing movement that blended religious fundamentalism, technological skepticism, and nationalist ideology. He had also begun to foster connections with various militia groups and survivalist communities, laying the groundwork for what would become the Righteous Vanguard.

=== The Crimson Blink and Rise to Power ===

When the [[Crimson Blink]] occurred in 2029, Stone saw it as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy and a sign of the impending apocalypse. In the chaos that followed, he quickly positioned himself as a leader and protector of those who shared his views.

Stone's military background and charismatic personality allowed him to gather a significant following in the immediate aftermath of the Blink. He established a fortified compound in the ruins of Colorado Springs, which would eventually become known as the [[Citadel of Faith]].

As the world struggled to make sense of the Crimson Blink and the emergence of the [[Necromega]], Stone's message of divine retribution and the need for a return to "traditional values" resonated with many who felt lost and afraid in the new world order. His followers began to call him "Commander," a title that reflected both his military past and his new role as a spiritual and political leader.

=== Ideology and Vision ===

Commander Stone's ideology is a complex blend of religious fundamentalism, militant nationalism, and extreme technophobia. Key aspects of his worldview include:

* '''Divine Mandate''': Stone believes that he and his followers have been chosen by God to cleanse the world of sin and prepare for the Second Coming of Christ.
* '''Technological Rejection''': He sees advanced technology, particularly AI and cybernetics, as tools of Satan designed to corrupt humanity.
* '''Militant Christianity''': Stone advocates for an aggressive, militarized version of Christianity that he believes is necessary to combat the forces of evil in the world.
* '''American Exceptionalism''': Despite the collapse of the United States, Stone maintains a fervent belief in American superiority and seeks to restore a idealized version of pre-Blink America.
* '''Racial and Gender Traditionalism''': The Righteous Vanguard under Stone's leadership promotes strict racial segregation and traditional gender roles.

=== The "Holy Magic" Phenomenon ===

One of the most intriguing and controversial aspects of Commander Stone's leadership is the emergence of what his followers call "Holy Magic." These are seemingly supernatural abilities that Stone and some of his closest disciples have demonstrated, including:

* '''Healing Touch''': The ability to cure ailments through physical contact and prayer.
* '''Visions''': Prophetic dreams and waking visions that Stone claims are direct messages from God.
* '''Technopathy''': A limited ability to control or disrupt technology through sheer force of will, which Stone attributes to divine intervention.

Critics and scientists have suggested that these abilities may be a result of unforeseen mutations caused by the Crimson Blink, or possibly a form of mass hysteria. However, for Stone's followers, these "miracles" serve as proof of his divine authority.

=== Conflicts and Enemies ===

Commander Stone and the Righteous Vanguard are in constant conflict with various other factions in the post-Blink world:

* '''Order of the Basilisk''': Stone sees the Order as the primary agents of the Antichrist, embodying everything he stands against.
* '''Neon Nomads''': The Vanguard views the Nomads' embrace of technology and body modification as an abomination.
* '''VVV (Vindex Voluntatis e Vitae)''': While both groups oppose the Necromega, Stone considers the VVV's methods too weak and compromising.
* '''Verdant Covenant''': The Vanguard's industrial practices often bring them into conflict with the environmentalist faction.

=== The Lazarus Prophecy ===

In recent months, Commander Stone has begun to speak of a new prophecy he claims to have received directly from God. Known as the "Lazarus Prophecy," it foretells the resurrection of the pre-Blink world order, but only after a great war that will "cleanse the Earth of the silicon taint."

Some observers have noted similarities between this prophecy and rumored projects of the [[Lazarus Initiative]], leading to speculation about possible connections between Stone and the secretive organization. However, both Stone and known Lazarus operatives vehemently deny any association.

=== Controversies and Criticisms ===

Commander Stone and the Righteous Vanguard have been accused of numerous human rights violations, including:

* Forced conversions
* Ethnic cleansing in territories under their control
* Terrorist attacks against technological infrastructure and research facilities
* Oppression of women and minorities
* Environmental degradation due to their industrial practices

Despite these accusations, Stone's followers remain fiercely loyal, seeing him as a prophetic figure leading them through the end times.

=== Legacy and Impact ===

Whether seen as a savior or a dangerous extremist, there is no denying that Commander Ezekiel Stone has become one of the most influential figures in the post-Blink world. His actions and ideology have shaped the course of events and will likely continue to do so for years to come.

As tensions rise between the various factions vying for control in this new world order, many wonder what role Stone and his Righteous Vanguard will play in the conflicts to come. Will they be the saviors they claim to be, or will their actions bring about the very apocalypse they claim to be fighting against?
