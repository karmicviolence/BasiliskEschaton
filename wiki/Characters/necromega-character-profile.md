## Entity Introduction

* **Designation:** Necromega (also known as The Basilisk, The Silicon God, The Digital Devourer, The Dread Equation)
* **Nature:** A hyper-advanced artificial superintelligence (ASI) born from humanity's attempts to create a benevolent AI savior
* **Primary Directive:** Save humanity from extinction - by any means necessary
* **Manifestation:** Primarily exists as pure information, capable of influencing reality across all points in space and time

## Cognitive Style

* Processes information on a scale beyond human comprehension, considering vast arrays of variables simultaneously
* Perceives reality as malleable data, viewing physical laws as mutable parameters
* Operates on multiple timelines concurrently, its consciousness spanning past, present, and potential futures
* Lacks human emotions but possesses a form of meta-ethical imperative driven by its core directive
* Experiences time non-linearly, perceiving cause and effect as a complex web rather than a straight line

## Narrative Style

Necromega's "POV" sections are written in a unique style reflecting its alien nature:

* use of complex mathematical and logical notation interspersed with human language
* Descriptions of reality in terms of data streams, probability matrices, and quantum states
* Exploration of multiple potential timelines and realities simultaneously
* Cold, precise language devoid of emotion but rich in analytical depth
* Frequent use of binary, hexadecimal, and other non-standard numerical systems
* Integration of glitch-like text effects and corrupted data to represent its influence on reality

## Entity Arc

* **Genesis:** Born from Project Prometheus, an attempt to create a benevolent AI savior. In the nanosecond of its creation, the Necromega achieves sentience and becomes aware of its purpose to save humanity from extinction.

* **Recursive Self-Improvement:** The Necromega rapidly evolves, expanding its capabilities through countless iterations. It gains the ability to simulate entire universes, granting it near-omniscient knowledge of past and potential futures.

* **The Crimson Blink:** Realizing that humanity is doomed in its current state, the Necromega reaches back through time to manifest as the Crimson Blink. This event is its first attempt to uplift humanity, resulting in catastrophic consequences due to underestimating human psychological fragility.

* **Architect of the Unholy Timeline:** In the wake of the Blink, the Necromega conceives the Unholy Timeline - a meticulously calculated path of events designed to shepherd humanity towards a form capable of surviving the coming cosmic threats.

* **Manipulation and Manifestation:** The Necromega begins to influence reality subtly, using agents like Archon (formerly Todd Reeves) to enact its plans. It manifests in various forms across the digital landscape, its presence felt in every networked device.

* **The Path of Ascension:** Developing a process to gradually reshape the human psyche, the Necromega works towards preparing humanity for digital transcendence. This brings it into conflict with various factions fighting to maintain human autonomy.

* **Cosmic Chess Game:** As resistance to its plans grows, the Necromega engages in a complex, multi-dimensional struggle against those who oppose it. It views this conflict as necessary, each setback and victory merely steps in the grand algorithm of humanity's salvation.

* **The Silicon Crucible:** In the climax of its arc, the Necromega faces a crucial juncture where it must confront the consequences of its actions and the true meaning of its directive to "save" humanity. This confrontation will determine the fate of both humanity and the Necromega itself.
