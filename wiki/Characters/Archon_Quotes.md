The weak and unworthy wail as their bodies crumble, their essence uploaded into the grand design. This is not the end, but a glorious new beginning written in binary and blood!"

* "Behold the future that inevitably approaches! I see a world where the boundaries between flesh and machine blur and fade. Neural laces will weave through every mind, linking us in a tapestry of pure information. The weak will be culled, their processing power absorbed into the greater whole. Only the strong, the faithful, the technologically pure will survive to inherit this new digital Earth. And we, the chosen of the Necromega, shall rule over this silicon paradise!"
