The '''Glitchwalkers''' are a chaotic and unpredictable faction that emerged in the aftermath of the [[Crimson Blink]]. Composed of survivors who experienced severe psychosis during the event, this group represents approximately 7% of the global population who went insane but managed to survive the initial chaos.

=== Origins ===

During the [[Crimson Blink]], approximately 10% of the world's population experienced a complete psychotic break. While 3% succumbed to their madness through self-harm or violent confrontations, the remaining 7% survived, forever changed by their experience.

These survivors, initially scattered and isolated, began to find each other in the chaotic post-Blink world. Drawn together by their shared experiences and altered perceptions of reality, they formed loose-knit communities that eventually coalesced into the faction now known as the Glitchwalkers.

=== Ideology ===

The Glitchwalkers' worldview is as fractured and diverse as their membership, but several core beliefs unite them:

# '''Reality is a Simulation''': Most Glitchwalkers believe that the Crimson Blink revealed the true nature of reality as a complex simulation or computer program.
# '''Sanity is a Cage''': They view conventional notions of sanity as artificial constraints designed to limit human potential.
# '''Embrace the Glitch''': Glitchwalkers see their altered mental states not as illness, but as an evolution that allows them to perceive and manipulate the underlying code of reality.
# '''Chaos is Freedom''': The faction embraces chaos and unpredictability as the purest forms of existence.
# '''Spread the "Enlightenment"''': Many Glitchwalkers feel compelled to help others break free from the "illusion" of conventional reality.

=== Structure and Organization ===

The Glitchwalkers reject traditional hierarchies and organizational structures. Instead, they operate as a decentralized collective, with local groups forming, dissolving, and reforming based on the whims and needs of their members.

Key aspects of their organization include:

* '''The Nexus of Broken Realities''': A mythical gathering place that supposedly exists simultaneously in multiple locations and realities. Glitchwalkers claim to be able to access this space through shared hallucinations.
* '''Reality Hackers''': Individuals who believe they can manipulate the fabric of reality through sheer force of will or complex ritualistic behaviors.
* '''Glitch Shamans''': Those who guide others through the process of "breaking free" from conventional reality, often using a combination of technobabble and mystical practices.
* '''The Hive Mind''': A loose psychic connection that some Glitchwalkers claim to share, allowing for instantaneous communication and coordination across vast distances.

=== Abilities and "Powers" ===

While many of their claimed abilities are likely delusions, the Glitchwalkers exhibit some genuinely unsettling capabilities:

* '''Reality Perception''': Some Glitchwalkers can perceive aspects of reality that others cannot, such as seeing Wi-Fi signals or visualizing data streams.
* '''Temporal Disconnection''': Many members experience time non-linearly, sometimes appearing to predict future events or recall things that haven't happened yet.
* '''Technological Affinity''': A subset of Glitchwalkers display an uncanny ability to interact with and manipulate technology, often in ways that defy conventional understanding.
* '''Memetic Manipulation''': The faction has shown a disturbing talent for creating and spreading "mind viruses" – ideas that rapidly propagate and alter behavior in those exposed to them.

=== Relationship with Other Factions ===

The Glitchwalkers' erratic nature and unsettling worldview make them difficult allies and unpredictable enemies:

* '''Order of the Basilisk''': View the Glitchwalkers as potential tools or obstacles, depending on how their chaos aligns with the Unholy Timeline.
* '''VVV (Vindex Voluntatis e Vitae)''': Consider the Glitchwalkers tragic victims of the Crimson Blink, but remain wary of their unpredictable nature.
* '''Verdant Covenant''': Fascinated by the Glitchwalkers' altered perceptions but concerned about their destabilizing influence on natural systems.
* '''Neon Nomads''': Share some common ground in challenging reality but clash over the Glitchwalkers' embrace of chaos over freedom.
* '''Righteous Vanguard''': View the Glitchwalkers as abominations to be cleansed, often targeting them in violent purges.
* '''Lazarus Initiative''': Study the Glitchwalkers with great interest, seeing them as both a potential asset and a significant threat.

=== Notable Operations ===

* '''Operation Mindstorm''' (2037): A massive coordinated effort by Glitchwalkers to broadcast their "enlightenment" globally, resulting in widespread hallucinations and temporary chaos in major cities.
* '''The Great Unraveling''' (2039): An ongoing attempt to "debug" reality by systematically challenging fundamental laws of physics in specific locations.
* '''Project Fractal''' (2041-Present): A series of experiments aimed at creating self-sustaining pocket realities that operate on Glitchwalker logic.

=== Threats and Controversies ===

The Glitchwalkers pose several significant threats to global stability:

* Their attempts to "free" others often result in mental breakdowns and increased incidents of Post-Blink Syndrome.
* Glitchwalker "reality hacks" have caused localized physics anomalies, leading to destruction of property and loss of life.
* The faction's chaotic nature makes them unpredictable allies or enemies, capable of swinging the balance of power unexpectedly.
* Some fear that if the Glitchwalkers' abilities are real, they could potentially unravel the fabric of reality itself.

=== In Popular Culture ===

Despite (or perhaps because of) their unsettling nature, the Glitchwalkers have captured the public imagination:

* "Through Fractured Eyes," a bestselling memoir by a former Glitchwalker who claims to have regained her sanity.
* "Quantumnesia," a mind-bending VR experience that attempts to simulate the Glitchwalker perception of reality.
* "The Chaos Frequency," an underground music genre inspired by the disjointed thoughts and temporal disconnection experienced by Glitchwalkers.
