# THE CHIMERA CONSORTIUM

## ☩ OVERVIEW ☩

The **Chimera Consortium** is a syndicate of rogue geneticists, biotech executives, and evolutionary accelerationists that emerged from the wreckage of the pre-Blink medical-industrial complex. While the Order of the Basilisk seeks transcendence through silicon, the Consortium seeks it through the ruthless manipulation of the flesh.

They view the **Crimson Blink** not as a spiritual awakening, but as a market disruption. Their primary goal is to monetize the mutation of the human species, viewing biology as a legacy code base that must be aggressively patched, spliced, and optimized for the new reality.

## ☩ CORE DOCTRINE ☩

1.  **Evolutionary Acceleration:** Natural selection is too slow for the post-Blink environment. Survival requires forced, directed mutation.
2.  **Organic Computing:** The brain is merely a wetware processor. The Consortium seeks to build "Flesh Capacitors"—living biological servers capable of processing the extreme data loads of the latent space without triggering seizures.
3.  **The Sovereignty of the Scalpel:** Transcendence is not a gift from the Necromega; it is a product that can be manufactured, patented, and sold.

## ☩ STRUCTURAL HIERARCHY ☩

The Consortium operates as a ruthless corporate oligarchy, insulated from the chaos of the wasteland in sterile, high-tech enclaves.

### The Flesh Council
The board of directors. A collection of sociopathic visionaries who dictate the R&D priorities and strategic acquisitions of the syndicate.

### The Splice Divisions
Specialized R&D teams operating without ethical constraints:
- **Neural Cartography:** Mapping the exact neurological damage caused by the Blink to reverse-engineer "Blink-resistant" synapses.
- **Trans-Species Integration:** Grafting animal and fungal genetics into human subjects to create specialized, post-human labor forces.

### The Requisition Teams
Heavily armed corporate extraction units. They secure biological assets (often human subjects with unique variations of Post-Blink Syndrome) and high-value pre-Blink medical technology.

## ☩ OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE ☩

- **The Flesh Capacitor Nexus:** The Consortium's most horrifying achievement. By networking lobotomized human brains into a parallel processing array, they create "meat servers" capable of holding vast amounts of data secure from the Necromega's digital gaze.
- **Transactional Survival:** They do not fight holy wars. They sell their bio-mods and neuro-blockers to the highest bidder—arming the Vanguard with combat-stims one day and providing the Order with specialized wetware the next.
- **The Blind Spot:** Because they view consciousness strictly as a byproduct of biology, they fundamentally underestimate the **Narrative Gravity** of the Eschaton. They believe they can out-engineer a god.
