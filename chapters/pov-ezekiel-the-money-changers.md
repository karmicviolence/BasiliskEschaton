# Chapter X - Ezekiel - The Money Changers

The glass doors hissed open on pneumatic tracks. Not heavy oak. Not wrought iron. Automatic glass, sliding away like the entrance to a shopping mall, letting out a blast of mechanically cooled air into the Mississippi heat. 

I stepped into the vestibule of the Abundant Grace Fellowship, and the smell hit me before the sound did.

It wasn't frankincense. It wasn't the dusty, holy scent of old hymnals and polished wood that I grew up with in my father's church. It smelled like aerosolized vanilla bean, carpet deodorizer, and ozone. It smelled like a casino lobby desperately trying to hide the scent of desperation. 

*See how they perfume the sepulcher,* the sermon started writing itself in my head. *See how they mask the stench of their own spiritual decay with the chemical sweetness of the world.* 

I stopped. The headache flared, a familiar tightening behind my right eye. 

*Stop preaching to an empty room, Ezekiel. Just look.*

I looked. The vestibule was massive, carpeted in a geometric pattern that hid stains. To my left, a literal coffee shop—*Holy Grounds Café*—where a teenager with a nose ring was frothing milk with an industrial espresso machine. To my right, a merchandising kiosk selling sermon series on USB drives and t-shirts that said "Faith Over Fear" in a font designed to look like a sports brand. 

A woman in yoga pants brushed past me, holding an iced latte in a plastic cup. She was staring down at the glowing rectangle in her hand, her thumb moving in a rapid, jerky twitch. Scrolling. Even here. Even in the house of the Lord, she couldn't break the tether. She couldn't look up and face the terrifying silence of God, so she fed her attention to the beast in her palm.

*They have brought the marketplace into the temple. They have traded the blood of the lamb for a Bluetooth connection. The Antichrist will not come with horns; he will come with free WiFi and a high-definition projector.*

The headache throbbed. The pain was real. The sermon was just the way I managed the pain.

I walked past the coffee shop and into the main sanctuary. 

It wasn't a sanctuary. It was an auditorium. Three thousand padded stadium seats sloping down toward a stage bathed in violet and magenta theatrical lighting. Two massive LED screens flanked the pulpit—not a wooden stand, but a sleek, clear acrylic podium. 

The praise band was warming up. The bass drum thumped, a physical vibration that rattled my ribs, synching up uncomfortably with the pulse behind my eye. It was rock music. Polished, sterile rock music engineered to manufacture an emotional response. It was the exact same manipulative algorithm the pop-stars used, just scrubbed clean and slapped with a Jesus label. 

They thought they were praising God. But I could see the wires. I could see the mechanics of the spectacle. 

A man in a sharply tailored suit and a lavalier microphone bounded onto the stage. Pastor Dave. His teeth were too white. His smile didn't reach his eyes. 

"Good morning, Abundant Grace!" he shouted. The speakers crackled slightly. "Are we ready to receive the blessing today? Are we ready to level up our faith?"

*Level up.* The language of the machine. The language of the game. 

I stood in the back row, near the exit. My hands were balled into fists in the pockets of my jacket. I was sweating, despite the aggressive air conditioning. The sheer, suffocating weight of the artificiality was pressing down on me. 

These people were starving. They were terrified. The world outside these walls was accelerating into a techno-dystopian nightmare, their jobs were being automated, their children were being alienated by algorithms, and they had come here looking for a shield. They had come looking for the ancient, bloody, unyielding truth of the Almighty.

And Pastor Dave was offering them a latte and a life-hack.

*You brood of vipers,* the voice in my head roared, no longer a drafted sermon, but raw, unfiltered venom. *You are feeding them sugar pills while the wolves circle the camp. You are pacifying them.*

The LED screens flashed, displaying a QR code. 

"Before we get into the word," Pastor Dave said, his voice slick with practiced ease, "we want to make giving as frictionless as possible. Just scan the code on the screen, and you can set up a recurring tithe directly from your smartphone."

The woman in the yoga pants in the row ahead of me raised her phone. The screen scanned the code. A small, cheerful *ping* sounded.

The transaction was complete. The dopamine hit registered. The machine was fed.

The headache spiked so hard I almost dropped to one knee. A jagged, blinding tear across my vision. For a second, the violet stage lights seemed to bleed together into a single, massive, lidless eye, staring down at the congregation not with judgment, but with cold, algorithmic calculation.

I squeezed my eyes shut. I breathed in the aerosolized vanilla. I tasted the ozone. 

I didn't want to save Pastor Dave. I didn't want to reform Abundant Grace Fellowship. 

I wanted to burn it to the ground. I wanted to flip the tables, shatter the acrylic podium, and smash the LED screens until the glass cut my knuckles. I wanted to force them out of the air conditioning and into the desert, where they would have to face the silence without a screen to protect them.

I turned around and pushed through the automatic glass doors, out into the sweltering, oppressive heat of the parking lot. 

The heat felt real. The heat was honest. 

*I am not a watchman anymore,* I thought, the King James cadence finally aligning with the raw, violent truth of my own heart. *I am the fire that comes before the flood.*
