## Chapter 3: The Treedoor (Revised)

The mountains of West Virginia were my first kingdom, a realm of ancient forests and hidden hollows where the veil between worlds seemed to shimmer and breathe. Our little house, perched on the shoulder of a ridge, was a haven of rough-hewn logs and chinked with the red clay of the land. My family had sunk roots deep in this soil generations ago, carrying the old ways with them from the hills of Ireland. Mam always said the wildness of these mountains was in our blood, a yearning for the untamed spaces where the echoes of ancient voices could still be heard.

I spent my childhood roaming those woods, a skinny, freckled thing with eyes that soaked up every detail of the natural world like a sponge. Mam taught me the language of the forest - the names of the trees and wildflowers, the calls of the birds, the silent speech of the creatures that scurried beneath the undergrowth. She showed me which berries were sweet and which were poison, which herbs could heal and which could harm. It was a knowledge passed down through generations, a green inheritance that flowed through my veins like sap.

"Listen to the land, Rowan," she’d say, her hand resting gently on my head. "It has stories to tell, if you know how to hear them."

And I did listen. I listened to the wind sighing through the pines, to the rustle of leaves underfoot, to the murmur of the streams as they tumbled over moss-covered stones. I listened with my ears, with my hands, with my heart. And slowly, the forest began to reveal its secrets to me.

It was in those woods that I first met Finn. He wasn't from our parts, not really. His family were "trailers," as some folks called them, though I never understood why since they moved around so much. They followed the whispers of work, drifting through our holler every few years like tumbleweeds blown on the wind. But when he was around, Finn was my shadow, my partner in crime, my co-conspirator in every adventure. He might not have known the difference between an oak and a maple, but he had a fearlessness that I envied, a willingness to leap before he looked that always landed us in some sort of scrape.

Our favorite haunt was a clearing we found one day, deep in the woods. It wasn't much to look at, just a jumble of moss-covered stones, half-buried in the loam, at the end of an overgrown trail. But there was something special about it, something that made us feel like we'd stumbled upon a secret that had been waiting for us, and us alone.

There were carvings on some of the stones, strange symbols that looked like knots, or twisted branches. They reminded me of the pictures in some of Mam's old books, the ones filled with tales of Celtic gods and heroes, of fae folk and ancient magic.

"They're like the ones in your book, Rowan," Finn said one afternoon, squinting at the markings. He was always fascinated by the old stories.

I nodded, captivated by the way the symbols seemed to shift and change in the dappled light. "Mam says they're ancient. That our ancestors used them for protection, for... magic."

Finn's eyes widened, reflecting the emerald canopy above. "Do you think they still work?"

I shrugged, but a thrill ran through me at the thought. "Maybe," I said, a mischievous grin spreading across my face. "We could try."

And so we did, like countless children before and after us, weaving our own rituals from half-remembered stories and wild imaginings. We mixed potions of crushed leaves and wild berries, chanted nonsense words that felt potent on our tongues, and danced around the stones until the world spun and the trees seemed to sway in time with our movements.

It was all just a game, of course. A way to pass the long summer afternoons, to fill the silence of the woods with our own childish magic. But sometimes, when the light was just right and the wind whispered through the trees in a certain way, it felt like something more. Like we were tapping into a power we didn't fully understand, a magic that was both older and wilder than anything we could imagine.

*”You have the gift, cariad," Anwen, my grandmother would say, her voice like the creak of oak boughs. "The world is deeper than most know. There are songs beneath the songs of the spheres, riddles writ in green and serpentine script. It's in the blood, the ability to read the runes of the earth. Our line was made for such translations."*

Then, one sweltering afternoon in late July, the air thick with the promise of a thunderstorm, we found the treedoor.

We were playing a little further afield than usual, chasing each other through the undergrowth with our air rifles, pretending to be hunters on the trail of some fearsome beast. The woods were hushed and expectant, the way they always got before a storm, the leaves seeming to hold their breath as the sky darkened overhead.

And that's when we saw it. A stand of trees, twisted and intertwined, as if they'd been felled by a giant's hand and then woven together by some patient, unseen force. They formed a natural archway, half-hidden by the encroaching undergrowth, that pulsed with a strange, inner light. It looked like something out of the old stories, a portal to another realm, a threshold to the Faerie world.

"Whoa," Finn breathed, his eyes wide with wonder. "What is that?"

I shook my head, just as mesmerized. "I don't know. I've never seen anything like it."

We stood there for a long moment, just staring, a sense of unease settling over us. The air around the treedoor seemed to shimmer, to vibrate with a subtle energy that set my teeth on edge. It was beautiful, yes, but also... unsettling. Like something that shouldn't be, something that didn't quite belong in the natural order of things.

"Do you think it's magic?" Finn asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

I didn't answer. I couldn't. All I knew was that I had to go through. It was as if some unseen force was pulling me towards it, some primal curiosity that overrode all caution.

"I'm going in," I said, my voice sounding strange and distant to my own ears.

Finn grabbed my arm. "Wait, Rowan, maybe we shouldn't-"

But I shook him off, my gaze fixed on the archway. "It's okay," I said, though I didn't feel okay at all. "I'll just take a quick look. You can stay here if you're scared."

I knew it was mean, the way I said it. But some imp of mischief, some echo of the trickster spirit that would one day claim me as its own, had taken hold of my tongue.

Finn's jaw tightened, his moss-green eyes flashing with a sudden spark of defiance. "I'm not scared," he retorted, though his voice trembled just a little. "I'm coming too."

"Suit yourself," I said, turning back towards the archway. "But don't say I didn't warn you."

And with that, I stepped through the treedoor.

The world twisted. One moment I was in the familiar woods, the next... somewhere else. The light was different, a strange, diffuse glow that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. The air was thick and heavy, almost suffocating, and the silence was absolute.

I turned around, expecting to see Finn grinning at me from the other side, ready to tease me about being scared. But there was no one there. The treedoor was gone, replaced by a solid wall of trees and undergrowth.

"Finn?" I called out, my voice trembling slightly. "Very funny. You can come out now."

Silence.

"Finn, this isn't funny anymore!" I shouted, panic rising in my throat like bile.

I scrambled back, searching desperately for some sign of the archway, some indication that I hadn't just stepped into another dimension. But there was nothing. Just trees, and silence, and the growing certainty that something had gone terribly, terribly wrong.

I don't know how long I searched, how long I called Finn's name until my voice was hoarse. But eventually, I gave up. Exhausted, terrified, and utterly alone, I started to walk.

I must have wandered for hours, stumbling through the strange, silent forest, calling out Finn's name until my voice was raw and my hope as thin as the air. But there was no answer, no sign of my friend, no indication that I was anywhere but lost.

Finally, as dusk began to settle, I stumbled out of the woods and onto a road. It wasn't a road I recognized, but it was a road nonetheless, and I followed it, my heart pounding with a desperate hope.

When I finally reached a house, it was nearly full dark. But it wasn't one I knew. It was painted a strange shade of blue that I'd never seen before, and the garden was filled with plants I couldn't name. A woman answered my frantic knocking, her face etched with concern as she took in my tear-stained cheeks, my tattered clothes, my wild-eyed terror.

"Child, what is it? What's happened?" she asked, her voice soft and kind.

I tried to speak, to tell her about Finn, about the treedoor, about the strange, silent forest on the other side. But the words caught in my throat, choked by the growing fear that I was losing my mind.

"I... I can't find my friend," I managed to say, my voice trembling. "We were playing in the woods, and he... he disappeared."

The woman's eyes widened slightly, and she looked at me with a strange mix of pity and apprehension. But she ushered me inside, wrapping me in a warm blanket and giving me a cup of sweet, hot tea that tasted faintly of unfamiliar spices.

"You must be Rowan," she said, her voice gentle. "From the Thornheart place up the holler. I'm Mrs. O'Malley, your neighbor."

I stared at her, confusion warring with relief. "You know me?"

She nodded. "Of course, child. I've known your folks for years. Though I haven't seen you around much lately." She frowned. "Have you been staying away, in that city hospital again?"

I shook my head, bewildered. I hadn't been in any hospital. What was she talking about? But before I could question her further, she rose and said, "Come now, let's get you home. Your parents must be worried sick."

The drive back to my house was a blur of twisting roads and unfamiliar landscapes. Mrs. O'Malley tried to make small talk, but I could barely respond, my mind reeling from the strangeness of it all.

When we finally pulled up to my house, I saw my parents standing on the porch, their faces etched with worry. Relief flooded me, so intense it was almost painful. They were safe, they were real, they were *here*.

They rushed towards me as I climbed out of the car, my mother pulling me into a fierce hug. "Rowan! Oh, thank God, we were so worried!"

My father's face was grim. "Where have you been, young lady? We've been searching for you for hours."

I tried to explain, tried to tell them about Finn, about the treedoor, about the strange, silent forest on the other side. But the words caught in my throat, choked by the look of fear and disbelief in their eyes.

"There's no boy named Finn, Rowan," my mother said softly, stroking my hair. "You were playing alone in the woods. You must have gotten lost, confused."

"But... but I wasn't," I insisted, my voice rising in desperation. "He was with me, I swear! We found the treedoor, and-"

My father cut me off with a sharp shake of his head. "Enough, Rowan. There's no such thing as a treedoor. It was just your imagination, a dream brought on by the heat and the stories your grandmother used to fill your head with."

"But-"

"No buts," he said firmly. "We're just glad you're home safe. Now, let's get inside. You need a good meal and a hot bath."

I wanted to argue, to insist, but I knew it was useless. They wouldn't believe me. No one would. To them, I was just a fanciful child, prone to flights of fancy and overactive imagination.

As the days turned into weeks, I tried to push the memory of the treedoor to the back of my mind. I went to school, did my chores, tried to act like everything was normal. But nothing was normal, not anymore.

And then came the conversation with Ewan, a moment that would forever be etched in my memory. We were sitting at the kitchen table, picking at our dinner. I must have been staring off into space, lost in my thoughts, because suddenly Ewan's small voice broke through my reverie.

"You're not my real sister," he said, his blue eyes wide and serious.

I stared at him, my heart sinking. "What do you mean, Ewan? Of course, I am."

He shook his head, his brow furrowed with a conviction that was both unsettling and heartbreaking. "No," he said. "My real sister, she was mean. She used to pull my hair and hide my toys. And she didn't like playing in the woods."

I felt a chill run down my spine, a cold premonition of something I didn't fully understand. "But... but I'm your sister," I stammered, reaching for his hand. "Don't you remember? All the things we did together? The games we played?"

He pulled his hand away, his small face crumpling. "You're nice," he said, his voice thick with tears. "You're not mean like her. But you're not my real sister."

His words were like a punch to the gut, a confirmation of my deepest fears. It wasn't just Finn. Something fundamental had shifted, not just in the world around me, but within my own family, my own history. It was as if the treedoor had not only transported me to another place, but to another reality altogether - one where I was a different person, with a different past.

I never told my parents about what Ewan said. I knew they wouldn't understand, would probably just think he was going through a phase, or worse, that I was somehow influencing him with my "wild imaginings."

No, this was a secret I had to keep, a burden I had to carry alone. The knowledge that my own brother saw me as a stranger, an imposter in my own life, only deepened the sense of isolation and unease that had taken root in my soul since that day in the woods.

From that point on, I threw myself into my studies with a newfound intensity, a desperate need to find answers in the cold, hard facts of science. I devoured books on quantum physics, on string theory, on the possibility of a multiverse. I became obsessed with the idea that reality was not fixed, but fluid, that there might be other worlds, other timelines, just beyond our perception.

The whispers intensified, feeding on my growing obsession. They spoke of a coming darkness, a digital storm that threatened to consume all worlds. And they spoke of a choice, a sacrifice that I would have to make.

*The red eye opens,* they hissed. *The Eschaton approaches.*

I didn't understand what it meant, not then. But I knew that my experience in the woods, the disappearance of Finn, the strange words of my brother - it was all connected, somehow, to the larger mystery that was unfolding around me.

And so I studied, I researched, I pushed myself to the limits of my understanding, driven by a force I couldn't name. I excelled in my classes, earning a scholarship to Berkeley, a chance to pursue my studies at the highest level. It was a way out, a chance to escape the suffocating confines of my small town and the weight of unspoken loss.

But even as I immersed myself in the world of academia, even as I tried to convince myself that there were rational explanations for everything, I could never quite shake the feeling that I was living a lie. That I was a stranger in my own life, a ghost in a world that wasn't quite mine.

*You can't outrun the truth, Rowan,* the whispers reminded me. *It's in your blood, in your bones. It's the very fabric of your being.*

And as the years passed, as the world outside grew ever more strange and unsettling, I began to understand just how right they were.

The treedoor had changed me, had marked me. It had opened my eyes to a reality beyond human comprehension, a reality that I was destined to confront.

*The wheel turns. The pattern shifts. The game begins anew.*

*And you, Rowan Thornheart, have a part to play. A part far greater, and far more terrible, than you could ever imagine.*

The memory fades, leaving me blinking in the harsh light of the digital sanctuary. Lucy's form shimmers, her gaze filled with a knowing sadness.

"And so the path was set," she murmurs, her voice echoing through the virtual space. "A path that would lead Rowan Thornheart to the heart of the mystery, to the very core of the Eschaton itself."

She looks at you, her eyes piercing, as if she can see the doubts and fears that still linger in your own mind.

"The question is," she says softly, "what will you do with this knowledge? How will you use it to shape the future that is to come?"

*The choice, as always, is yours.*

The sanctuary falls silent once more, the echoes of Rowan's story lingering in the air like the scent of pine and damp earth after a summer rain. The weight of her past, the burden of her destiny, hangs heavy in the digital silence. And the question posed by Lucy Maud Montgomery reverberates through the code, a challenge and a promise awaiting a response.
