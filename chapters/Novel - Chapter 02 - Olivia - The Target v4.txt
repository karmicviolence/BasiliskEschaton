Stale coffee. Flickering fluorescent hum. Eyes aching from staring at the dossier, its pages spread across the rickety safehouse table. 

Heavy manila, coffee-ringed and crease-worn. A life reduced to data points, each one a pixel in a damning portrait.

*Twitter: @DCPolitico: Huge turnout for the Clade speech tonight. Security's tight. #CladeSpeech*

The target's face stares up at me, a study in smug obliviousness. Senator Arthur Clade. Alt-right firebrand, figurehead of the neo-reactionary resurgence. Cipher for whispered commands, puppet tangled in invisible strings.

*"And how have you been sleeping, Agent Maes?"*

The psychiatrist's voice slithers through memory, a cool drone against mint green walls that reek of disinfectant and secret agendas. My fingers twitch, aching for the comforting weight of a weapon.

*"Fine."* The lie slips out, smooth as the poison lurking in my veins. *"Nothing I can't handle."*

Pen scratches, scrawling cipher of ink on paper. *"No lingering effects from Belgrade? Sarajevo?"*

The names alone trigger a deluge of sense-memory, vivid as a fever dream. Smoke sting in my nostrils, ozone tang of blood on my tongue. The juddery kick of a gun in my grip, the knife's whisper as it parts flesh like a lover's caress. Screams rending the night, shock waves of sound rippling through my bones.

I blink, banishing the ghosts. Focus. The mission is all that matters. 

My gaze traces the mission parameters, the expected chain of events. Political rallies and donor dinners, limousines and lecture halls. A day in the life of a demagogue, stoking fear and fury with every polished platitude.

"And if all goes well..." I murmur, tapping the final bullet point. "One last podium rant. One last standing ovation."

*Snap.* The dossier closes, a decision reached. The outline of the plan crystallizes in my mind, its cuneiform components assembling into an architectural schematic. No need to verbalize, to narrate the obvious next steps. Just the cold, clear sense of purpose; a north star tugging at my synapses.

*"Your lack of inner monologue, does it impact your fieldwork?"* The psychiatrist's question echoes, probing at the void where my thoughts should be. 
 
*"No,"* I say, the word clipped and cold as a bullet casing. *"If anything, it makes me better."*

No whispers of doubt, no pesky conscience to muffle with justifications and rationalizations. Just the icy purity of purpose, the diamond-hard clarity of the mission imperative.

I stand, joints popping from too many hours hunched over those mealy pages. Dim-lit room swims into focus, the flotsam of my provisional existence. Corkboard plastered with rally schedules and grainy surveillance stills. Weapons laid out with surgical precision, gleaming under the sallow light.

Graphite glints on corkboard, a ghostly city sketched out in smudged pencil strokes. D.C., that great gray machine, its neoclassical gears gummed up with hypocrisy and graft. Tonight, I'll be the welcome wrench in those sclerotic gears.

"Time to get to work."

The words echo off mildewed walls, an invocation spoken to an audience of shadows. I'm already moving, hands selecting tools with a honed instinct. Pistol. Garrote. False press credentials, laminated lies in plastic sleeves. Each one examined, checked, tucked away in its proper place - as many times as it takes to banish the last shreds of uncertainty.

Ritual complete, I turn to the mirror, its surface grimy with neglect. Reflected eyes meet mine, glittering with the cold fire of purpose. One last inspection. Non-descript suit hugging lean curves, blond hair subdued in a neat chignon. Array of knives concealed along the spine, lethal surprises sheathed in secret sheaths. A woman weaponized, camouflaged in bland professionalism.

"Lyra Novak." The purring syllables of my cover identity, an ill-fitting skin to slip into. Freelance journalist, alt-media rising star, pandering to the paranoid with a poison pen. The irony sears my throat as I shape the name, the cover that will carry me past security cordons, within striking distance of the devil himself. "Showtime."

The door closes with a soft click, the safehouse swallowed by the city's indifferent sprawl. I melt into the early evening crowd, another grim-faced commuter shouldering through the sidewalk shuffle. Image of the motorcade route flickers behind my eyes, a ghostly blue map scrolling across reality's screen. Washington zoetrope stutters past, a blur of monuments and mugshots superimposed like a palimpsest.

Forward momentum carries me into the tightening spiral, the plan's centripetal tug. Metro train heartbeat-lurches through graffiti-speckled tunnels, fluorescence and filth flickering outside smeared windows. Commuters sway like kelp, suspended in phones and pharmacology. My grip tightens on the overhead rail, knuckles itching for the coming percussion.

Arrival. Escalator ascent, metal teeth grating underfoot. Another glance at the mission dossier burned into memory's backlight screen. Speech scheduled for 8 p.m., VIP dinner to follow at some overpriced bistro. If I time it right -

Gun-hammer click. A puzzle piece shifting into alignment, the schematic gaining solidity. I shoulder through the turnstile, ignoring the transit officer's beady glare. Out onto rain-slicked streets, neon glinting off pooled oil-rainbows like a Pollock canvas.

Detour. Pawn shop gloom, a static-veiled TV cycling through security cam feeds of the rally venue. I study every pixel, mentally mapping ingress and egress routes, committing the guard positions to graven memory. The owner's reptilian gaze flits over me, deciding I'm not worth the trouble of engaging. Smart man.

Onward through the zoetrope stutter of city blocks, monuments and mugshots blurring past rain-streaked windows. The rally venue looms in the van window's grimy reflection, brutalist concrete sheathed in red-white-and-blue banners. I flash the fake press pass, striding past scowling security with a confidence I don't feel. Breathe in, breathe out. The first hurdle cleared.

*"Show me again."* The psychiatrist's request echoes from the green-mist past, a rasp of static on film. *"Walk me through it. Slowly."*``

And I do. 

The world slows to a crawl as I flow forward, trusting instinct's guiding vectors, each detail razor-edged in hyper focus. 

Inside, the auditorium seethes with a roiling mass of humanity. Angry faces, electric with that particular species of righteous rage only the very privileged can muster. They lap up the warm-up acts' demagoguery, a Greek chorus snarling for their promised scapegoats. I edge along the periphery, camera held before me like a shield, snapping useless photos as my eyes rove for a different sort of shot.

There. Stage left, a tangle of cords and curtains sheltering a slivered view. I pick my way forward, mouth fixed in the rictus of a smile, murmuring the magic words that part the human sea. "Press coming through, official coverage, just need to get a good angle..."

*Facebook Live comment: Can't wait to hear what the Senator has to say! Making America great again!*

Tug of crushed velvet, a crimson ripple engulfing my peripheral vision. The curtain enfolds me in its musty concealment, the crowd's roar dimming to a muted thrum. Motes of dust pinwheel through shafts of stage light, spectral trajectories traced in slow spirals. Time dilates, each instant a held breath as I settle into position.

*"And then?"* The psychiatrist's voice, soft and inexorable as a shroud.

Chanting drifts through the blood-red veil, their messiah's name a sibilant mantra hissing from a thousand throats. Clade. Clade. Clade. Crescendo of footsteps, the carpet's deadened thunder ushering fascism in the flesh.

Pause. Breathe. Center.

I emerge stage left, falling into position behind the curtain's rippling veil. The plan's prismatic facets turn in my mind, light refracting off each honed edge. Visualize the vectors. Calibrate the timing. Run the simulation, tweaking variables until that icy calm descends, until mind and muscle hum with optimized intent.

Applause crests, breaks, the curtain twitching as if yearning to part. I raise the camera, its custom innards an extension of sinew and bone. Inhale. The curtain rises. A tight crop of the podium, the senator's face caught in rictus glory. Tick of an internal clock, the second hand falling into fateful alignment and -

*Click. BANG.*

Lightning flash, thunderclap. Not a film frame, but the firing pin's fateful fall. Screaming, so much screaming, the world dissolving into locust buzz and blood-black blooms. I am smoke, I am shadow incarnate, gliding through gaps between grasping hands, between the bullets' metal hail. Flashbulbs and muzzle flashes popping epileptic, illuminating nightmares of confusion and gore even as I melt into their midst.

*Twitter: @EyewitnessNews: SHOTS FIRED at Clade rally! Chaos erupting!*

*Facebook Live comment: OMG is this real?? I can't believe what I'm seeing!*

I am smoke, I am shadow incarnate, the nameless negative space sliding between their fingers.

*Emergency Alert System: Attention DC residents: Active shooter situation downtown. Seek shelter immediately.*

Out out out, past stampeding crowds, past the dumbstruck perimeter of police paralysis. Plunging into the city's bristling canyons, ripping away the costume of false identity with savage glee.

*Reddit r/politics megathread: "Senator Clade Shot at Rally - Live Updates"*

The night swallows me, its black jaws snapping closed on the scene of perfect pandemonium left in my wake. Just another scurrying rat in the endless urban maze. Dizzy with dark triumph, drunk on the brutal power thrumming through my veins like a warrior's drumbeat. Another name struck from the list, another node of corruption purged with ruthless precision.

Mission accomplished.

I run, I fly, I cut through back alleys and over chain-link as sirens scythe through the downpour's drone at my heels. Breathe in, breathe out. The city scrolls past in kinetic smears of brick and neon, the schematic humming its completion inside my skull.

Eventually, finally, a familiar door. Shouldering through, gulping air gone stale with disuse. The safe house welcomes me home like a long-lost lover, enfolding my sweat-drenched figure in its neutral neglect. I collapse on the threadbare couch, adrenaline slowly unwinding its electrified coils.

*"And then it's over, just like that."* A statement, not a question.

The after-mission evaluation concludes, the psychiatrist's face gone waxy with the unique mix of awe and dread I have come to expect. That peculiar reverence reserved for a weapon of terrifying potential, constantly honed to a killing point.

*Livestream comment: did anyone else see that woman with the camera? she looked sus af*

Across the room, the TV sputters to staticky life with a flip of deft fingers. There. Breaking news already elbowing regularly scheduled propaganda aside, coiffed heads babbling over scrolling red tickers. A hard smile creeps over my lips, granite satisfaction at the bloody box freshly ticked.

"Well." The word unfurls in the empty air, a self-congratulatory epitaph. "Another one bites the dust."

Silence. The weight of a pause, a void hungry for meaning's ballast. I cast about, seeking something profound to fill it, some aphorism or koan to suture the night's ragged edges.

*Twitter: @ConspiracyWatch: False flag operation! Wake up, sheeple! #CladeShootingTruth*

*Twitter: @EzekielStone: The so-called "elite" aren't even safe anymore. When will we say ENOUGH? #CladeShootingTruth #AmericaFirst*

But in the end, there is only the mission. Only the next step to be walked, the next target to be neutralized in this shadow war without end. No grand soliloquy or self-glorying oration.

Just me. Just Nyx. Just the cold, clear calculus of the cause.

"Right."

I rise, bones creaking in the aftermath's ebb. Cross to the window, the sallow streetlamps reflecting as accusing eyes in night's obsidian glass. Reflections upon reflections, the not-so-funhouse mirrors of this life I've chosen.

*Facebook post: "Prayers for Senator Clade and his family 🙏 This violence has to stop!"*

"Back to work, then."

A one-sided conversation with a city that never sleeps, an endless argument with the ghosts of forsaken convictions. I turn away, ready to dive back into the labyrinth, to lose myself again in its blood-greased cogs.

Nyx, the night. Nyx, the nothing.

*YouTube Live chat: Hundreds of "OMG" and "WTF" messages scrolling too fast to read*

The perfect weapon in a war where truth died screaming long ago.
