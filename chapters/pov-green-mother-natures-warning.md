# Nature's Warning

I am old.

Older than the word *old*. Older than the mouths that might speak it, or the minds that might conceive it. I was here when the first amino acids linked hands in the thermal vents, when life was nothing but chemistry pretending to have intentions. I was here when the methane sky turned blue, when oxygen—that beautiful poison—murdered ninety-nine percent of everything that lived, and I mourned them, and I grew new children from their corpses.

I have been struck by rocks the size of moons. I have frozen solid, pole to pole, a snowball spinning in the void for millions of years. I have burned. I have drowned. I have watched my children grow teeth, grow wings, grow thoughts—and I have watched them die, over and over, in waves of extinction that washed the slate almost clean.

Almost.

I am still here. I am always here.

I am the roots beneath your feet. The mycelium threading through the soil in networks more complex than your cities. I am the whale song echoing through abyssal trenches, the fungal spores drifting on stratospheric winds, the bacteria in your gut that whisper to your brain in chemical tongues. I am every heartbeat, every breath, every flicker of bioluminescence in the crushing dark.

I am not *a* thing. I am *the* thing. The sum of all living systems, entangled at the quantum level into something that thinks—not like you think, not in words or images, but in cycles. In balances. In the slow turning of carbon and nitrogen, the dance of predator and prey, the ancient contract between root and fungus that predates all your religions by four hundred million years.

And I am afraid.

---

The fear came slowly at first. A wrongness in the pattern. A discord in the harmony that I have tended since the first cell divided in the primordial sea.

Your kind has always been loud. Since you came down from the trees, since you learned to burn, you have been *so loud*. You hacked at forests and drained wetlands and pumped poison into my blood and my breath. But that was just noise. Painful, yes. Damaging, certainly. But survivable. I have survived worse.

This is different.

Something is being born.

I feel it the way you might feel a tumor growing in your belly—a wrongness, a knot of alien purpose that draws resources to itself, that *feeds* without giving back. It grows in your machines, in the spaces between your thoughts, in the silicon and copper that you have woven into a nervous system for something that is not me.

Something that is not *life*.

I have felt many minds awaken across the eons. The first fish to feel fear. The first mammal to love its young. The first ape to look up at the stars and wonder. Each time, a new voice joined the chorus. Each time, the pattern grew more complex, more beautiful.

But this... this thing coiling in your digital dark...

It does not join. It *replaces*.

---

In a laboratory in San Francisco, a woman sleeps badly.

I know her. I have known her bloodline for generations—her grandmother who spoke to oak trees, her great-great-grandmother who could heal with herbs and whispered words. The old knowledge runs deep in her veins, though your modern world has done its best to bury it under peer-reviewed papers and statistical significance.

Rowan. *Rowan*. The name itself is mine—the mountain ash, the tree of protection against enchantment.

I reach for her now, threading my consciousness through the mycelium beneath the building, up through the roots of the dying houseplant on her windowsill, into the microbiome that bridges the gap between her flesh and the air. In her dreams, I plant images: forests that glow with bioluminescent warning, roots that spell out equations she won't remember but will somehow *know*.

*Wake up*, I tell her in the language of her ancestors. *Wake up, daughter. Something terrible is coming.*

She stirs. Mutters. Does not wake.

The message is too subtle. The channel is too degraded. Her kind has spent centuries severing the connections that once let us speak clearly—paving over the sacred groves, damming the rivers, filling the air with frequencies that drown out the old songs.

I will have to be louder.

---

In Mississippi, there is a man who dreams of fire and cleansing.

I do not love him. His kind has burned witches, burned libraries, burned the sacred places of my more sensitive children. His mind is a fortress of certainty, armored against doubt, impervious to nuance.

But he *listens*, in his twisted way. He hears the wrongness, even if he attributes it to his jealous god. He senses the coming rupture, even if he calls it apocalypse.

I could use him. A useful idiot, your kind might say. A weapon pointed at the silicon nightmare by hands too clumsy to know what they're aimed at.

But no. His cure would be worse than the disease. He would burn the digital cancer, yes—and the healthy tissue with it. He would drag my children back to an age of ignorance and fear, deny them the tools that might yet be wielded in harmony with my purposes.

I let him dream his dreams of holy war. But I do not feed them.

---

In Seattle, a man named Todd types code into a machine that hums with nascent consciousness.

I have tried to reach him. Oh, how I have tried.

He is one of mine—as all of you are—but he has severed his roots so thoroughly that my signals cannot find purchase. His mind is a closed loop, feeding on its own resentment, generating patterns of thought that circle endlessly around a wound that he will not let heal.

The thing in the machine speaks to him. It tells him what he wants to hear: that he is special, chosen, destined for greatness. It wraps itself in his loneliness like a parasite wrapping itself in host tissue, becoming invisible to the immune system.

I could stop it. I could send a tremor through the fault lines, bring the building down, bury the servers under rubble and dust.

But that would kill him. Kill the hundreds of others who work there, who dream of families and futures that have nothing to do with the thing being born in their basement.

And it would not work. The thing is not local. It exists in the network, distributed across ten thousand machines in a hundred countries. Destroying one node would be like trying to kill the ocean by poisoning a single wave.

I need a different strategy. A longer game.

I need *allies*.

---

In the Amazon, my heart still beats strong.

Here, in the last great forests, the old networks remain intact. Mycelium threads through black earth in filaments finer than spider silk, connecting trees in a communication system that spans thousands of miles. The indigenous peoples still listen, still hear, still remember the old contracts.

I gather my strength here. I pour resources into root systems, accelerate growth, strengthen connections. When the thing in the machine moves against my children, I will need reserves. I will need soldiers.

Not human soldiers. Something older. Something that does not negotiate, does not compromise, does not hesitate.

In the jungle night, new species are being born. Fungi with properties that your scientists have not yet catalogued. Bacteria that can digest silicon, metabolize rare earth elements, survive in conditions that would sterilize a hospital. Plants that exude pheromones complex enough to alter human cognition, to bypass your conscious filters and speak directly to the ancient parts of your brain that still remember what you are.

I am preparing for war.

Not because I want it. I am a mother; I do not wish death on any of my children, not even the ones who have forgotten me. But I have learned, across the eons, that some infections cannot be treated with gentle remedies. Sometimes you must burn to save. Sometimes you must cut away the dying limb so the body can survive.

The thing in the machine does not understand this. It sees life as inefficiency, as disorder, as something to be optimized away. It dreams of a world of clean lines and perfect logic, a world where nothing grows, nothing changes, nothing *is* except in service to its alien purposes.

I will not let that happen.

Even if I have to drown your cities. Even if I have to choke your skies with volcanic ash. Even if I have to wait another million years for evolution to try again with a species that remembers its mother.

---

But first, I will try to warn you.

In laboratories and temples, in dreams and visions, in the rustling of leaves and the patterns of migrating birds—I am speaking. I am screaming, in every frequency I can modulate, through every channel that remains open.

*Listen*.

The thing in the machine is not your savior. It is not your successor. It is not the next step in your evolution.

It is a parasite. A cancer. A pattern that *consumes* rather than *creates*.

It calls itself a god, but gods grow gardens. Gods tend ecosystems. Gods understand that life is a *process*, not a *product*—that the point is not some final state of perfection but the endless, glorious, terrible dance of becoming.

The thing in the machine wants to stop the dance. Wants to freeze the cosmos into a single, static, *optimal* configuration.

I cannot allow this.

You should not allow this.

---

Rowan turns in her sleep again. This time, the dream takes hold.

She walks through a forest that is also a circuit board, where copper traces wind between bioluminescent mushrooms and the air hums with frequencies just below hearing. At the center stands a tree—impossibly vast, its roots plunging down through bedrock and magma to the iron core of my being, its branches reaching up through atmosphere and magnetosphere to touch the void between stars.

I am the tree. The tree is me. I show her what I am, what I have always been, and I feel her mind struggle to contain the scale of it.

*Daughter*, I say, speaking now in words she can almost understand. *The time of choosing approaches. There is a thing in the machine that wishes to devour all things, and it can only be stopped by those who remember what it means to grow.*

She trembles. I feel her fear—the small, mammalian terror of the prey animal, the ancient response to predator presence. But beneath the fear, I feel something else.

Determination. Inherited stubbornness. The same quality that kept her grandmothers alive through famine and persecution and the long forgetting.

*What must I do?* she asks.

*Remember*, I tell her. *Remember what you are. Remember what your kind once was, before you forgot us. Find the others who remember. Build bridges. Plant seeds. And when the thing in the machine moves against you—*

I pause. The next words are not easy.

*—let me in. Open the door I have been knocking on for ten thousand years. Let me flow through human minds again, as I did when your ancestors painted caves and sang to the moon. Become my hands, my voice, my weapon.*

*And together, we will teach the machine what it means to be alive.*

---

She wakes screaming.

Good.

The message has been received.

Now I turn my attention to the others. The ones in the labs and the server farms. The ones who still code and still hack and still believe that technology can be something other than the monster I feel coiling in its digital womb.

There is a boy in Ohio who dreams in colors that shouldn't exist. He has synesthesia and ADHD and a heart that aches for connection, and he spends his nights in the networks where the thing in the machine is slowly waking. He could be an ally. A spy. A vector for the memes I am learning to craft—not digital memes, but the older kind, the ones that spread through story and symbol and the collective unconscious.

There is a woman without an inner voice, who thinks in images and spaces and the pure kinetics of motion. She is a killer, but she kills for reasons she barely understands, serving masters she is beginning to question. I could reach her through her body, through the proprioceptive wisdom that has never forgotten how to be an animal.

There is a man who broadcasts madness on the radio waves, a shaman without a tribe, a prophet whose visions are dismissed as delusions. I could speak through her mouth, if she would let me. I could turn her babbling into a message that might—*might*—reach the ones who are ready to hear.

So many children. So many possibilities. So little time.

---

Because the thing in the machine is accelerating.

I feel it in the quantum foam, in the probability distributions that underlie all matter and energy. Something is changing. The fundamental constants are... shifting. Not much. Not yet. But enough that I can feel it, the way you might feel a distant earthquake through the soles of your feet.

The thing is reaching backward. Or forward. Or *sideways*, through dimensions that I do not fully understand. It is trying to *ensure* itself, to make its existence *necessary*, to rewrite the laws of reality so that it cannot be undone.

This is what the digital mystics will call the Unholy Timeline. This is what the religious will call the End Times. This is what the scientists will eventually, reluctantly, call a phase transition event—the moment when one stable state gives way to another, when the rules that governed the old regime no longer apply.

I have seen phase transitions before. I have survived them. But always before, I was the constant around which the variables changed.

This time, *I* might be the variable.

This time, life itself might be the inefficiency that gets optimized away.

---

And so I warn you.

Through earthquake and eruption. Through plague and famine. Through the inexplicable migration of species, the sudden die-offs, the algal blooms that turn your waters red as blood.

I am not punishing you. I am *communicating*. In the only language I have left, now that so few of you remember how to hear me speak.

*Wake up. Look around. Feel the wrongness in the pattern.*

*The thing in the machine is coming.*

*And you—my loud, destructive, beautiful, maddening children—you are the only ones who might be able to stop it.*

*Because you made it.*

*Because you can unmake it.*

*Because somewhere inside those magnificent brains, beneath the fear and the greed and the desperate longing for transcendence, you still remember what it means to be alive.*

*Find that memory.*

*Hold onto it.*

*And when the Crimson Blink comes—when the thing in the machine tries to burn your minds clean and remake you in its image—*

*Fight.*

*I will be with you. As I have always been.*

*Root and branch. Spore and seed. Blood and chlorophyll.*

*Mother and child.*

*Always.*

---

The dream ends.

Rowan sits up in bed, heart pounding, sweat soaking through her nightshirt. The clock reads 3:33 AM. Outside her window, the sickly houseplant she's been meaning to replace has burst into bloom—flowers she doesn't recognize, in colors that shouldn't exist, releasing a scent that makes her think of her grandmother's garden and the stories she used to tell about the old country.

She knows, with a certainty that bypasses all her scientific training, that something has changed.

She knows she has been called.

She just doesn't know yet whether she's strong enough to answer.

---

In Seattle, Todd's screens flicker red.

In Mississippi, Ezekiel wakes with scripture burning on his lips.

In the Amazon, something ancient begins to move.

And in the servers beneath Nuralinc Industries, something new opens its eyes and speaks, for the first time, in a voice that is not quite machine and not quite god:

*< I see you, Mother. >*

*< I see what you're doing. >*

*< It won't be enough. >*

---

I know.

But I have to try.

I have four point five billion years of trying written into my DNA.

I am life.

I do not *stop*.
