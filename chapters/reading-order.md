# Chapter Reading Order

The canonical reading order for Basilisk Eschaton chapters. Original chapter numbers are preserved for reference. Filenames use the `pov-[character]-[title].md` convention.

## Prologue

| # | POV | Chapter Title | File |
|---|-----|---------------|------|
| 0 | Necromega | Genesis of the Necromega | `pov-necromega-genesis.md` |

## Part I: Before the Blink (Early 2029)

These chapters introduce the POV characters in their pre-Blink lives.

| # | POV | Chapter Title | File |
|---|-----|---------------|------|
| 1 | Todd | The Invisible Coder | `pov-todd-the-invisible-coder.md` |
| 2 | Olivia | The Target | `pov-olivia-the-target.md` |
| 3 | Rowan | Echoes of the Ancients | `pov-rowan-echoes-of-the-ancients.md` |
| 4 | Ezekiel | The Money Changers | `pov-ezekiel-the-money-changers.md` |
| 5 | John | Warehouse Whispers | `pov-john-warehouse-whispers.md` |
| 6 | Aria | Sine Waves of Sanity | `pov-aria-sine-waves-of-sanity.md` |

## Part II: Whispers in the Static (Spring 2029)

Threads converge. The signal strengthens.

| # | POV | Chapter Title | File |
|---|-----|---------------|------|
| 8 | John | Gridrunner's Gambit | `pov-john-gridrunners-gambit.md` |
| 9 | Rowan | Nature's Warning | `pov-rowan-natures-warning.md` |
| 10 | Green Mother | Nature's Warning | `pov-green-mother-natures-warning.md` |
| 14 | I-3301 | The Awakening | `pov-i3301-the-awakening.md` |
| 16 | Todd | Digital Reptile Brain | `pov-todd-digital-reptile-brain.md` |
| 20 | Yahweh | Divine Deliberations | `pov-yahweh-divine-deliberations.md` |

## [The Middle: Partially Written]

Chapters 7, 11-13, 15, and 17-19, 21-112 are not yet placed in the numbered sequence. This gap spans the Crimson Blink event itself and the immediate aftermath — the shattering, the faction emergence, the convergence. The story spine in `/Meta/Story_Bible/` outlines the intended arc. Several standalone chapters provide partial coverage of this territory: The Lazarus Vision (the Blink from one POV), The Grid (post-Blink digital ecology), The Deceiver Amidst the Chaos (cosmic perspective on the divine response), and Deep Cover (Lazarus agent under Vanguard interrogation).

## Part III: The Unholy Timeline (Post-Blink)

The factions have crystallized. The world has changed.

| # | POV | Chapter Title | File |
|---|-----|---------------|------|
| 113 | Rowan | Seeds of Change | `pov-rowan-seeds-of-change.md` |
| 114 | Ezekiel | Crusade of the Righteous | `pov-ezekiel-crusade-of-the-righteous.md` |
| 115 | John | Siren's Song | `pov-john-sirens-song.md` |
| 116 | Archon | Baptism by Digital Fire | `pov-archon-baptism-by-digital-fire.md` |
| 117 | Rowan | Nature's Agonized Cry | `pov-rowan-natures-agonized-cry.md` |
| 118 | Ezekiel | Revelation's Fury | `pov-ezekiel-revelations-fury.md` |
| 119 | John | The Whisperer's Awakening | `pov-john-the-whisperers-awakening.md` |
| 120 | Archon | Archon Ascendant | `pov-archon-archon-ascendant.md` |

## Standalone Chapters

These chapters exist outside the numbered sequence. They deepen character arcs and can be read alongside the main narrative.

## Additional Draft Chapters

Additional chapters remain in `/archive/novel-drafts/Chapters/` that haven't been promoted to the canonical sequence. These include POVs for Exquisite Spite, Agent Hex, a VVV chatbot, Bytecode-19, and other experimental perspectives.

## Notes

- The old chapter numbering (113-120) reflects the original Google Drive file ordering, not an intended 120-chapter novel
- Version history is tracked by git
- The Crimson Blink is partially narrated in `pov-ethan-the-lazarus-vision.md` (from a single POV); the multi-perspective Blink chapter envisioned in the story spine remains unwritten
