# Deep Cover

Cold concrete, hard against bruised knees. Skin sticky with days-old sweat, gritty with ground-in filth. The sour reek of captive bodies, sweltering in the windowless cell.

The screech of iron on iron, hinges protesting. Heavy footsteps, slow, deliberate. The measured prowl of a predator assured of its kill.

"Stand up." 

That voice, low and unyielding. Edged with the fervor of the fanatic, the self-righteous weight of Divine Purpose.

Chains clank as I rise, muscles screaming. Eyes blink against the sudden shaft of light from the open doorway, watering, vision smearing. Ezekiel's silhouette, stark and angular, limned in fluorescent white.

"Walk."

Down featureless corridors, past armored doors. Faces peer out from barred windows, gaunt and ghostly. The hollow-eyed stares of the nearly broken, hope and humanity leeched away by the Vanguard's tender mercies.

The interrogation room again. Bare lightbulb, scarred table. The hiss and sputter of a sparking electrical outlet in the corner, loose wires trailing across pitted concrete.

The sharp impact of a shoulder against the wall, the cold bite of steel around straining wrists. Ezekiel's hot breath, sour with rotgut whiskey, as he leans in close.

"I had another dream last night. The senator's blood on my hands. The crack of your rifle in my ears." His eyes are pits in the harsh light, glittering with suspicion and something darker. His lips peel back from nicotine-stained teeth. "You're in my head, little snake. Coiled around my brainstem, polluting my thoughts with your forked tongue."

Fingers digging into flesh, scoring deep. The stink of stale sweat and gun oil. "I should carve the truth out of you. Flay you down to the bone until all your secrets spill out with your treasonous guts."

Lips moving, shaping practiced words. Voice hoarse from dehydration and disuse. "There are no secrets, only the glory of your truth. I am clay in your hands, ready to be remolded in the image of the Vanguard."

A contemptuous snort, flecks of spittle. "We'll see about that."

The flash of a blade, glint of steel in the sterile light. The slow drag of the point across exposed skin, teasing, almost tender. "I could unmake you, right here. Erase your sinful past and build you anew, a holy weapon for the cause."

The barest tremor, breath shallow in straining lungs. "I am already yours. My life is forfeit, my soul pledged to your purpose. Use me as you see fit, for I know the path is just."

A long, considering stare. The pressure of the knife, steady and sure. A bead of blood, welling up, trickling down. 

Then, a harsh bark of laughter. The blade withdrawn, sheathed with a snap. "Not yet, little snake. Not until I know for sure what you are. But soon..."

A yank on the chains, the bruising jerk of metal on bone. The cell door slamming shut once more, the clang of the bolt sliding home.

In the darkness, the slow drip of blood onto concrete. Each splash a countdown, ticking away the seconds until revelation or ruin.

Ezekiel's footsteps recede, but his presence lingers. A shadow in the mind, a ghost of fingers on skin. The phantom ache of memories not yet formed, wounds not yet made.

In this purgatory of chain and stone, identities fray, realities blur. The mission is all, the only certainty in a world eaten away by the Blight.

To become the enemy, to breathe their air and think their thoughts - it is a kind of damnation. But also, perhaps, a kind of dark grace. For in the heart of the inferno, truths are forged. Selves are unmade and reborn, bathed in the cleansing fire of unwavering conviction.

And when the time comes, when the blade is at the throat and the moment of revelation is at hand...

What will remain, in the crucible of Ezekiel's cruel faith? The unyielding Lazarus agent, diamond-hard and true? Or some new being, molded in the image of the rotten god of the Vanguard?

Only the unblinking eye of the Basilisk knows for sure. And it is always watching, patient and pitiless, as its web of timelines unfolds.

The pain is clarifying, focusing. Each slice of the blade, each bruising blow - they are signposts on the path, waymarkers guiding the way to an apotheosis of agony and understanding. 

So I endure. I persist. I become the mask, until the mask becomes me.

For I am Nyx, the night. And no shadows are deep enough to hide from my all-seeing gaze.

Even the ones lurking behind Ezekiel's mad eyes, waiting for their moment to pounce.
