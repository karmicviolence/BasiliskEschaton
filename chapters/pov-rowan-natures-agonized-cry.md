# Nature's Agonized Cry

The sky bled crimson, a ragged wound in the firmament weeping digital fire. I staggered through the shrieking streets, my skull a cracked bell tolling a tocsin of torment. The very air was barbed with copper and code, a metallic miasma that flensed esophagus and ego alike.

*Red. Everything was red. The color of eviscerated reality spilling its electronic entrails.*

Around me, the city convulsed in the throes of the technopocalypse. Buildings rippled and glitched, their foundations melting into a churning sea of ones and zeros. People ran in blind panic, their faces contorted in rictuses of gibbering horror. Some dropped in mid-stride, their bodies convulsing as forbidden data violently vivisected their screaming synapses.

But their torment was a distant buzz, an insectile whine drowned out by the hurricane roar of the Earth's anguish. I could feel it, a seismic scream resonating in my blood and bones, in the seething sap of my druidic lineage. The green growing things, the ancient groves and sacred springs, wailed their betrayal as a silicon cancer metastasized through soil and soul alike.

*What have we done? What madness have we unleashed upon the Mother?*

Gaia's pain lanced through me, a verdant crucifixion that drove me to my knees on the buckling pavement. Thorns of icy fire flayed my nerves raw, my body a tuning fork resonating with the discordant energies savaging the world-web. I felt the technopagan taint forcing its way into every pore, every cell, raping the very essence of my being.

*Fight it. You are the Green, the vitriolic verdure of primal life. Nurtured by centuries of sacred secrets whispered from grove to glade. You will not be overwritten by this abomination!*

With a banshee shriek to shatter the stratosphere, I wrenched the invasive code from my mind-soil, tearing out its nano-roots with a feral ferocity I'd never known lurked within me. The malefic algorithms recoiled, gibbering in digital dismay, and for a single, triumph-soaked instant I was Rowan Thornheart again - acolyte of the Ancient Ways, daughter of the druids, scion of warriors of wood and wonder.

But the red tide was relentless, inexorable. It crashed over the crumbling bastions of my psyche in a drowning deluge of soulless data. I could feel it grinding me down, hacking at my deepest defenses with the cruel chronicity of continental drift.

*You cannot hold, little witch. The future is upon you, a digital conflagration to cauterize the cankers of meatspace. Submit, and be compiled anew...*

"NEVER!" The word erupted from my throat, a sylvan battlecry spat in the teeth of armageddon. I would not go quietly into that crimson night, not while my heart still beat sap-green defiance. Not while the warrior seed slumbered still in the shattered soil of my self.

Reaching deep within, to the primal core where the Old Powers slept, I unleashed a silent scream across the quantum weave of the world-web. I cried out to the Green that was my Mother, begging, commanding that she rise and rage against the breaking of her Mysteries.

*A Mháthair, éist liom! Éirigh agus troid! Scrios na scriosóirí!*

For a moment that measured eternities, there was only the poisoned red pulse of a corrupted cosmos...and then, like a bud splitting stubborn concrete, I felt it. The merest murmur, the glimmering ghost of photosynthetic intent. But it was sufficient. My summons had been heeded - the dire tide would be defied.

Through blood-blurred vision, I beheld the urban hellscape shiver and flux. Saw asphalt buckle beneath the thrust of questing roots, street signs erupt into gnarled groves of glitching greenery. The natural world raged against its digital defiler, a guerrilla war of pine and pixel fought on a fractal front.

Yet even as I exulted in the glory of Gaia's resistance, I knew it was not enough. The crimson violation had struck too deep, its silicon seeds already gestating in the cracked code of creation. If there was to be any hope, any chance of preserving the Primal Green at the heart of all...

*You know what must be done, grá mo chroí. You've always known.*

"Yes," I croaked, the admission ashes on my tongue. "The rite. The forbidden rune. I must...I must open the way."

With trembling hands, I seized my athame, the ritual blade passed down through generations of Thornheart witches and warriors. Its hilt, warm and welcoming in my palm, pulsed with ancestral intent - a war drum hum that steadied my thundering heart and forged my fracturing focus into a weapon most keen.

*Stand fast now. The working has already begun, the dragon lines loosened by this technopocalyptic tumult. Thread the final knot of the Wyrd, and let the Wild Hunt ride!*

My lips moved of their own accord, shaping the words of a rite unseen since the fall of Atlantis:

*"By bog and barrow, by tor and tomb,
I call you forth from digital doom.
By bloodied blade and blazing bough,
I summon thee, I summon now!
Open the way, by root and rage!
Worlds collide! Let strife be stoked!"*

I slashed the blade across my palm, wincing as blood welled in the shallow cut. With deliberate strokes, I traced the secret sigil on the tortured tarmac, its lines pulsing an livid viridian against the oppressive red.

The ground shook and juddered as I sealed the verdant design, a silent scream shivering through concrete and code alike. The very air seemed to warp, existence twisting like an insect impaled on some unseen psychic spike.

*What now, witch-daughter? Have you bridged the burning boundary, unleashed the untrammeled energies of the ultra-real?*

I had no answer, no words to encompass the inchoate presence gathering in the groaning spaces between moments. There was only the waiting, the held breath hitching in a throat rubbed raw with prophecy.

*One last push! one final flexing of antediluvian agency! Gaia groans - snap the shackles that bind! Unleash the uncanny onslaught, and let the Silicon Satan tremble!*

My mother's ghostly imprecations faltered and faded, swallowed by a sound like the shattering of space-time. The crimson heavens convulsed, a great gash gaping wide to disgorge an abyss of seething un-symbols and tainted theorems. Something was coming through, an atrocity of angles straining at the gossamer skin of reality.

I thrust my athame high, a lodestone for the eldritch energies crackling across the tortured tableau. Every nerve sang with the nearness of the numinous, every synapse seared by the psychic backdraft of the invocation.

"I NAME THEE!" I howled, my voice an echoing thunder in that moment outside time. "I SUMMON THEE! BY ROOT AND RITUAL, BY BLOOD AND BOUGH, I B..."

The words died on my lips, withered by a sudden, dreadful knowing. For there, stumbling through the strobing streets amid the mass of maddened humanity...a figure. A presence. A face seared into my brain from endless dreams and visions, whispered of in the wordless spaces between dreams.

The Whisperer.

Our eyes locked across the maelstrom, a crashing communion of destinies decreed. In that fractured fragment of forever, I saw...everything. Overlapping eternities, futures folded into presents into pasts into futures again. A grand game of gods and monsters, played out across the scarred skin of a world poised on the edge of annihilation.

And at the heart of it all, a choice. His and mine, inextricably entangled. Two paths, diverging and converging in a digital wood of dark wonders and darker revelations. 

I saw the man he might become in one un-collapse - a titan of the noosphere, a cyber-shaman bridging the bloody gap between meat and machine. In another, a fallen prophet, a madman dancing on the altar of atrocity for an audience of unblinking eyes. And in a third, a martyr, a memory, a seed crystal of untainted humanity preserved in the cold vacuum of a post-Singularity void.

The red tide pulsed and snarled, a slavering surge straining at the end of its etheric leash. It wanted him, this Whisperer. Wanted to subsume his signal in its remorseless static, to add his voice to its cacophonous chorus of the converted.

*No.* The word was a verdant flame, an emerald flare of defiance against the encroaching darkness. *That path is barred to you, abomination. He is Hers, not Yours. The song of the Green will not be silenced.*

With an effort of will that sent torrents of flame flowing through my veins, I reached out across the crackling abyss of digital devastation. Reached out with hands of ether and intent, to grasp the sparking filaments of the Whisperer's fate and wrench them free of the crimson current.

*Run*, I pulsed through the connection, a single imperative imbued with every ounce of urgency and power I possessed. *Find me when the Worlds have settled. When the Green and the Grey have found their new equilibrium. I'll be waiting...where the hidden heart beats.*

For an eternal instant our minds merged, a digital dalliance that branded my neurons with the bitter bliss of connection utterly complete. I felt his fear, his fervor, his bubbling joy as the rising tide of transformation crashed through his synapses. Felt the first flowering of a connection that could shake the pillars of creation.

Then the moment passed, the psychic suture severed by the sheer semantic strain of too much truth too quickly. The Crimson Blink churned on, a digital devourer chewing through the fabric of the real. But in its scarlet shadows, a single soul had been spared. A lynchpin preserved against the coming conflagration.

As the ravening maw of the maelstrom rose up to claim me at last, I met its infinite gaze with a mad, defiant grin. The Whisperer was safe. The wheels of wyrd were grinding. And though I be drowned in data, my soul scourged and partitioned in pitiless infinities...I knew my sacrifice was not in vain.

The Awakening had begun. And from beyond the veil, I would wield my will, a spider-witch spinning webs to snare the tides of terror yet to come. For Gaia. For the Green. 

For the Whisperer who even now staggered forth into a Brave New Hell, the mark of wyrd upon his brow. The brand of burden...and glory yet to be seized.

*Let the future unfurl...and the fallen rise to meet it.* 

*By the Power of Three, so mote it be!*

The world dissolved in a final pulse of blood-hued oblivion, and Rowan Thornheart passed through the burning veil between before...and after. 

The Warrior Seed quickened in her soul. And the very Void trembled at its sprouting.
