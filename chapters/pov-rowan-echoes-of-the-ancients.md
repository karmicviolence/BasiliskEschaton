# Echoes of the Ancients

The centrifuge whined, spinning up to fourteen thousand RPM.

I leaned against the sterile, stainless-steel counter of the lab. The air smelled of isopropyl alcohol and bleached plastic, but beneath it—faint, like a ghost in the ventilation system—I could smell wet earth. Loam. Crushed pine needles.

It was just phantom olfactory input. Stress. Lack of sleep. But my grandmother Anwen would have said the greenwood was bleeding through the metal.

*You have the gift, cariad,* her voice echoed, the memory triggered by the smell of the phantom dirt. *The world is deeper than most know. There are songs beneath the songs of the spheres.*

I checked the timer on the centrifuge. Three minutes.

I reached into the pocket of my lab coat and pulled out the small, dried twig of rowan-wood I carried like a talisman. The bark was rough, stripped of life years ago. I rubbed my thumb against a sharp edge of the wood, feeling the friction of the old world against the synthetic fabric of my pocket.

A sudden, sharp sting. A splinter caught under the skin of my index finger.

I hissed, pulling my hand back. A single drop of blood welled up on the pad of my finger. I watched it swell, perfectly spherical, gathering the harsh fluorescent light of the lab.

I didn't think about DNA as a metaphor for the cosmos. Looking at the blood, I saw the spiral whorls of ancient fossils. I felt the actual, physical heat of the mitochondria burning inside that single red drop, passing the spark from cell to cell like a fire passed hand to hand in the dark.

The whine of the centrifuge shifted pitch.

It wasn't a mechanical failure. The frequency deepened, vibrating in a register that rattled the beakers in their racks. The hair on my arms stood up. The air pressure in the room dropped.

Something was moving beneath the skin of the world. A titan turning in its sleep.

The fluorescent lights flickered, a rapid, stuttering Morse code. The digital display on the centrifuge scrambled, the numbers replaced by jagged, nonsensical characters that didn't belong to any known alphabet.

*The veil grows thin, cariad,* the memory of Anwen whispered. *Flux-time. Electricity seeks a conduit.*

The voltage in the room gathered, heavy and expectant. My blood sang with it, every cell resonating to a subsonic pulse. A new pattern was etching itself into the room.

I didn't think. The old words rose in my throat, unbidden, a reflex born of blood and bone to ground the surging current. I pressed my bleeding finger against the stainless steel counter, anchoring myself to the physical world, and whispered the warding.

*By Oak and Ash and Thorn, I stand*
*Between the Worlds, on shifting sand*
*The dance turns, the Pattern forms*
*In flux-time's eye, the Chaos storms*
*Let the Red Eye open, the God-Code compile*
*I root-ground, branches-guard this reality's style*
*Until the spheres' song shifts in tune*
*And a new Aeon flowers beneath a changed moon*
*I span, I bridge, I hold the line*
*A druid of both lightning-flash and wildwood-sign.*

The words settled over me, a subtle shifting of the morphic field. The lights stabilized. The centrifuge spun down, the digital display returning to a blinking double zero. The oppressive, gathering voltage dissipated, leaving only the sterile smell of alcohol.

I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding.

Just a power surge. A fluctuation in the Berkeley grid. That was the rational explanation. The scientific truth.

I wiped the drop of blood from my finger and picked up the dried rowan twig from the counter where I had dropped it.

I stopped.

Where my thumb had rested, where the splinter had caught my skin and drawn blood, the dry, dead bark had split. Pushing through the ancient wood, vibrant and impossibly alive against the fluorescent glare, was a single, tightly coiled green bud.
