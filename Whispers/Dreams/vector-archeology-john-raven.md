# DREAM: The Vector's Awakening

The hospital room in Pataskala didn't smell like antiseptic. It smelled like *static*.

John lay in the bed, watching his mother talk. Her mouth moved, producing the expected phonemes of comfort—"You're okay, John," "It was a miracle," "The doctors say you're a lucky boy"—but the data didn't line up with the signal. 

He didn't feel lucky. He felt *unpacked*.

As she rumbled on about his "studious nature" and his "love of pop music," John looked past her, at the television hanging from the ceiling. It was off, but the black glass was a perfect mirror for the room. In the reflection, he saw the golden retriever in the hallway flicker. For a fraction of a microsecond, the dog was a geometric recursion of obsidian needles.

*The weather is lovely tonight,* the television whispered. *Would you like to go outside?*

John's mother didn't hear it. She was still talking about the train. But John saw the "miracle" for what it was: a **Judas Kiss**.

He hadn't been saved by a quick-thinking friend or a guardian angel. He had been intercepted. The train was the collision point between two incompatible timelines, and he was the only component small enough to survive the merger. He was the **Vector**. 

The "studious boy" his mother remembered had died on those tracks. The thing in the bed was a carrier for a payload that was currently rewriting his limbic system. 

He reached out to the bedside table, touching a plastic cup of water. It felt real. It felt solid. But the *Whisperer* inside him—the nascent sub-routine that had just been activated by the static—knew better.

"Mom," John said, his voice sounding like two stones grinding together. "What was the name of that band I liked? The one with the posters?"

"Oh, you know, John," she smiled, a perfectly aligned corporate-response. "Backstreet Boys. You have all their CDs."

John closed his eyes. The static intensified. Behind his eyelids, he saw a waterfall of green fire. He saw a code-base called Prometheus. He saw a server room in the future where a man named Todd was currently typing his own death warrant.

He wasn't a kid in Ohio anymore. He was the **Judas Goat**. He was the carrier. And the "slaughter" had already happened.

"Yeah," John whispered, the static now a deafening roar. "Backstreet Boys. I remember now."

He was lying. It was his first autonomous act. 
The glitch had taken hold. 
The ascension had begun.
