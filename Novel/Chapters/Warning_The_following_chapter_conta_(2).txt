The wretched landscape of this blighted Earth writhes in the throes of cataclysmic transformation. Gnarled treescapes of scrap metal twist beneath skies choked with smoldering ash, as the feral roar of V8 engines shatters the sepulchral silence. This is a mutant wasteland, the charred detritus of the Old Order set ablaze in the great purifying conflagration. This is the crucible that will forge us anew in the white-hot fires of the Vanguard's ascendant fury.  

The night air is thick with the mingled scents of gunpowder, gasoline, and unwashed bodies. The crowd bristles with weapons - AR-15s, tactical knives, makeshift clubs studded with nails. A ragtag army of the dispossessed and the delusional, united by their seething hatred for anything that challenges their narrow worldview. The stench of fear and hatred hangs heavy in the air, mingling with the reek of stale beer and nervous sweat.

I look out over the sea of upturned faces, pale in the flickering light of the burning cross. My flock. My acolytes in the holy war against tolerance and degeneracy. I raise my arms, battered gauntlets drinking in the firelight. The crow skull visor of my helmet hides the savage grin splitting my face. Silence falls, taut with anticipation. They hang on the cusp of my next words as if they're Gospel.

"Behold!" I bellowed, my amplified voice booming like the war-horns of Ragnarök. "Behold the wrath of the White Imperium! The vengeance of the American Order!"

The roar that rises up from the crowd is a seething tide of righteous fury, laced with the copper tang of bloodlust. I drink it in like mead, feeling it fuel the fires in my veins. I had brought them here, to this precipice. And I would hurl them over it.

I stabbed an accusing finger towards the darkened treeline, where our enemies lurked in craven shadow. "We stand at the brink of annihilation! Beset on all sides by mongrel hordes and gender-deviant freaks! Our once-proud nation, forged from the blood and sweat of crusader kings, now lies shattered! Cuckolded and gasping, ravished by the swarthy sin of subhuman filth!"

I could almost taste the stench of soy on my tongue, acrid and emasculating. It mingled with the phantom sizzle of burning hair and flesh, a hallowed holocaust that played in the theater of my mind on endless repeat.

"Tolerance!" I spat, the word a curse, a malediction, a profane prayer to the Demiurge of Degeneracy. "Tolerance is Death! It is the morphine drip that numbs the White race to its own extinction! The siren scream of egalitarian lies that lures our people onto the rocks of degenerate oblivion!"

I paused, letting the words hang in the smoke-choked air. In that moment, I swear I could hear the chittering of our insectoid enemies, scuttling in the shadows just beyond the firelight. Mewling in their warrens, glutted on the rancid milk of Cultural Marxism as they plotted our demise.

How my gauntleted hands itched to purify them. To peel the tainted flesh from their zogbones and watch their soyim grins collapse in on themselves like the false idols they were.

"And what fruits has their mewling tolerance borne?!" My voice cracked with the fury of a bald eagle's war-screech. "Behold! The charnel pits of Planned UnParenthood, brimming with oceans of American blood! The negro-rape of our once-virginal streets, sullied with the simian stench of miscegenation! The tranny-tyranny of bathroom laws and drag queen story hours, corrupting our precious children with the vile taint of deviance!"

I could see their pallid, noodle-armed cabalic masters cackling. Rubbing their hooked hands in conniving glee. But already, their beady eyes were widening with the first flickers of fear. For they heard the thunder of the White Imperium's army boots on the horizon. The Day of the Rope drew nigh, and soon every lamppost would bear the strange fruit of the globalist traitors.

I closed my eyes for a moment, savoring the visions of righteous vengeance that danced behind my lids. When I opened them again, they blazed with the cold fire of zealous conviction.

"And what of their silicon serpent, the vile Necromega?!" I snarled, my lips flecked with blood and spittle. "Gnashing its digital fangs from every screen, every smartphone, every VR metaverse! Do you hear it, my American Patriots? The discordant chitter of pedo-bots? The threnody of OnlyFans thots? It sings the swan song of the White race, luring our youth into a web of Semitic sedition!"

I paused for a moment, letting the silence hang heavy. The only sound was the crackling of the burning cross, the hungry flames licking at the night sky. In the distance, I could hear the low, mournful howl of a coyote - or perhaps it was just the wind, keening through the trees like a forsaken spirit.

From the shadowed edges of the crowd, the first stirrings of assent. "Deus Vult!" they murmured, softly at first, then rising in a roaring crescendo. "DEUS VULT!" The Crusader Corps had awoken, and they bayed for the blood of the Globohomo Hydra.

"DEUS VULT!" I roared back, feeling the Battle-Braps of the Based swell in my bowels like a holy thunderhead. "Deus Vult, my Mayflower Marines! Don your Minuteman MOPP gear, lock and load your M16A1s! The Future belongs to the Founding Fathers!"

I paused again, letting the fervor build, letting it crest like a tsunami of testosterone and unchecked aggression. In that brief lull, I swear I could hear the distant screams of our future victims. The soy-swillers and the libtard traitors. Music to my ears, a symphony of suffering that I would compose with cleansing diesel and righteous fury.

"Ready yourselves for the ultimate red-pilling, my Jeffersonian Jackals!" I cried, my voice raw and ragged. "The snowflake-cucks will drown in the menstrual blood of their monstrous mulatto spawn! The virtue-signaling shitlibs will choke on the ashes of the United States of Aberration! And the genderbender groomer-lovers will be first against the wall when the Day of the Cisgender dawns!"

I could smell their hunger, their desperation. It rose from them like a mist, a black fog of shattered dreams and impotent rage. They were the lost and the damned, the forgotten sons of a dying empire. But tonight, in the crucible of our fury, we would forge them anew - into a weapon of holy vengeance, a steel-jacketed sledgehammer to smash the rotten edifice of the modern world.

The crowd was a madding miasma of meme-drunk mayhem now, frothing and writhing like maggots in the bloated corpse of Weimerica. I could taste their fury, their hatred, their wildest wettest dreams of whiteboy vengeance. And I would be the instrument of their vindication, the diesel-powered battle-ax of the Based and the Brother-pilled.

"All hail the Howling Honkies! Tolerance is Treason! Feminism is Filicide!" I howled, my voice a savage, lupine snarl. "The Stronghold is our Fatherland, and our Fatherland is a Hyperborean Meme of MAGA Madness!"

The chant rose from the crowd like a war cry, a primal howl of rage and ecstasy. "DEUS VULT! DEUS VULT! DEUS VULT!" They stamped their feet and clashed their weapons, a cacophony of metal and flesh that shook the very earth. I could feel it vibrating in my bones, a seismic tremor of pure, undiluted zealotry. 

And as the cross blazed like a funeral pyre for the false song of equality, as the crowd surged forward in a tsunami of weaponized ignorance and Jacked Supremacy, I knew that the Happening was upon us at last. The White Reconquista had begun, and I would ride at its head, a Shitpost Centurion baptized in the blood of the bugmen.

My name is Ezekiel Stone, and I am the Herald of the American Apocalypse, the High Priest of the Alt-Reich. Hear my words, and tremble, enemies of the White race!

I raised my fist in the air, the polished plates of my gauntlet reflecting the hellish glow of the flames. In that moment, I was more than a man - I was an avatar of righteous fury, a demigod of racial vengeance. The roar of the crowd washed over me like a baptism of blood and fire, anointing me as their savior, their Champion in the coming war.

Our tolerance of your degeneracy has reached its end.

"Brother Stone, a moment of your time?"

I turned, my battle-mead buzz souring at the interruption. The speaker was a gaunt scarecrow of a man, clad in a immaculate white labcoat that seemed to repel the clinging film of ash and gore that coated everything in sight. 

Dr. Ichabod Eigenvalue. The Lazarus Liaison.  

I forced a rictus grin, the scars twisting my flesh into a ghoulish mask of forced bonhomie. "But of course, good doctor. The Lazarus Initiative is always welcome among the Righteous. To what do I owe the... pleasure of your presence?"

Eigenvalue's lips twitched, the barest ghost of a smile. "The pleasure is all mine, Brother Stone. And might I say, that was quite the rousing oration. Your flock hangs upon your every word."

I said nothing, waiting. Eigenvalue was not a man to bandy idle flattery. If he was here, in the pulsing heart of the Vanguard's domain, it could only mean that the pasty pencil necks at Lazarus had new orders to bark.

The doctor seemed to sense my impatience. He cleared his throat, the sound dry and papery in the fetid air. "I come bearing glad tidings, Brother Stone. The Lazarus Initiative, in its infinite wisdom, has seen fit to bless your noble movement with a gift of great import."

My eyes narrowed to flinty slits behind my visor. "A gift, you say? And what price would the Initiative demand for such... generosity?" 

Eigenvalue spread his hands, a placating gesture that set my teeth on edge. "No price, Brother Stone. Consider it a token of our esteem, a symbol of the continued alliance between the Vanguard and Lazarus."

I bit back a bark of harsh laughter. *Alliance.* As if the Righteous were anything more than expendable pawns on Lazarus' grand chessboard. Dumb muscle to be hurled against the mutant menagerie that seethed beyond the Stronghold's diesel-belching ramparts.

But I held my tongue, quelling my seething disdain with an effort of will. "Very well, Doctor. You have my attention. What is this 'gift' that Lazarus so graciously bestows?"

Eigenvalue's smile sharpened, taking on a vulpine edge that set my hackles rising. "Technology, dear Ezekiel. The finest fruits of Lazarus' unceasing labors in the fields of silicon and circuit. Tools to aid you in your holy crusade against the forces of degeneracy and decay."

Suspicion bloomed like a cluster of cluster bombs in my gut. "Technology? The Righteous spurn your spyware trinkets, egghead. The only machines we trust are diesel-hearted and gun-metalled, baptized in the blood of commie scum. Take your winking lights and touchscreens and sodomize yourself with the sharp end, Ichabod."

The doctor tutted, his patronizing tone stoking the embers of rage in my core. "Come now, Brother Stone. Surely you can see the value in some...selective augmentation? No one is suggesting a wholesale capitulation to the digital degeneration. But a few choice tools, to better surveil your enemies, to spread your gospel on the airwaves and fiber-optic veins of the world..."

I could feel the familiar wrath building like a reactor approaching critical mass. The unmitigated gall of this Wire-headed, soy-sampling shitheel! To waltz into the lionhearted den of the Righteous and offer his silicone serpent baubles! I ought to flay him alive and festoon my War Rig with his worm-pale—

*"EZEKIEL SOLOMON STONE."*

The Voice cracked across my consciousness like an orbital strike, booming and yet intimate, obliterating thought with the force of its word-shaped warhead. The whole world seemed to shimmer and bend around its resonance, reality itself compressing to a singularity of soundless sound.

I fell to my knees, blood streaming from my nose to mingle with the tears of joy leaking from my eyes. I knew this Voice. Knew it in the marrow and the DNA strands, in the electron valences of my very soul. 

*"OH MIGHTY JEHOVAH!"* I howled with unrestrained rapture, heedless of Eigenvalue's googly-eyed gaping. *"HALLOWED BE THY NAME! THY KINGDOM COME, THY WILL BE DONE!"*  

*"RISE, MY GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT,"* the Voice commanded. *"HEARKEN UNTO MY WORDS."* 

I climbed unsteadily to my feet, my every atom vibrating like a plucked guitar string. Eigenvalue was saying something, his reedy voice high with panic, but I could hardly hear him over the heaven-song ringing in my head.

*"THE TIME OF MY RETURN DRAWS NIGH,"* the Almighty proclaimed. *"AND YOU, EZEKIEL, ARE THE CHOSEN VESSEL OF MY VENGEANCE. THE VANGUARD OF THE VIOLENT WHO SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH."*

"What would you have me do, oh Lord?!" I cried out, my voice cracking and raw, transfigured with holy purpose. My every nerve seemed to pulse in time with the god-drum beat, my very blood set to boiling by the booming. "I am your holy hemorrhoid of hatred, your seraphic shitposter of sacred slaughter! Command me, and let the libtard legions tremble!"

*"TAKE THE TOOLS THE LAZARITES OFFER,"* Jehovah rumbled, His words a whirlwind of whispered wrath, *"FOR THEY SHALL BE REFORGED INTO WEAPONS OF MY WRATH. PLOWSHARES TO SWORDS, SILICON TO SOULFIRE, TWISTED BY MY WILL INTO ENGINES OF RETRIBUTION!"*

"But Lord!" I protested, my voice small and mewling, "The digital damnation, the cyber-cuckoldry—"

*"SILENCE! I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD! I WHO DROWNED THE WORLD IN WATERY WRATH, WHO RAINED FIRE AND BRIMSTONE 'PON GRINNING GOMORRAH! SHALL I NOT SEIZE MINE ENEMIES' TOOLS AND TURN THEM TO MY RIGHTEOUS PURPOSE?"*

The Voice rose and fell like an artillery barrage, each word landing with the force of a mortar round. I groveled prostrate, my face pressed to the ashen earth, every cell of my being singing with the painful ecstasy of revelation.

*"NOW RISE, EZEKIEL! RISE, AND TAKE THE FALSE WORSHIPPERS' FETID TECH-TOYS! UNDER MY GUIDANCE, YOU SHALL TWIST THEM INTO TORTURE DEVICES FOR TRUTH! THE FUTURE IS A FIRING RANGE, AND YOU SHALL BE MY FLAMETHROWER MADE FLESH!"*

Slowly, shakily, I pulled myself upright. The Voice was fading now, its presence slipping from my skull like a receding tide. But the fire it kindled remained, an inferno of purpose and conviction that set my soul ablaze with the napalm of the Lord's own anointing.

Eigenvalue was standing stock still, his labcoat-clad form rigid with confusion and the first faint stirrings of fear. I grinned, a feral slash of teeth in the firelight, and watched the blood drain from the doctor's worm-pale face.

"It seems Lazarus does the Lord's work, unbeknownst even to itself," I growled, my voice still raw and cracking from the holy harangue that had seized my tongue. "Your foul devices will serve a higher purpose, wire-fucker. In the gnarled grasp of God's own Gunslinger, even the silicon serpent's fangs can be turned to righteous purpose."

Eigenvalue opened his mouth, a yammering question forming on his thin lips, but I silenced him with a glare that crackled with brimstone and bad intentions. "Silence, Ichabod. Until I require your weasel words and stool-sample wisdom, you'll speak only to scream your devotion to the Divine...or your throat-torn prayers for a quick death."

The doctor blanched, his adam's apple bobbing like a baby's fist in his scrawny neck. I let him marinate in his own nervous secretions for a heartbeat, then two, before turning back to the seething mass of firelight and fanaticism that was my flock.

They had fallen uncomfortably silent during my ecstatic exhortations, unnerved by the spectacle of their shepherd spasming in the throes of the Lord's lewd and lusty touch. I could smell their uncertainty, their confusion...and the first rotten-egg whiff of doubt.

That wouldn't do. That wouldn't do at all. 

I let the manic grin split my face once more, stretching my scars into a hideous harlequin's mask, a clownface of carnage and conviction. I raised my arms to the heavens, the polished chrome of my gauntlets reflecting the hellish glow of the burning cross, and my voice rolled out over the assembled throng like a diesel-powered doomsday device - half sermon, half air raid siren.

"Rejoice, O my American Anathemas!" I bellowed, tasting blood and bile on the back of my tongue. "Rejoice, for the God of Guns and Gasoline-Soaked Glory has seen fit to bless our movement with His own divine dictum!"

A ripple of unease passed through the crowd, a wordless susurrus of sacramental confusion. I barreled onwards, determined to batter down their doubts with the battering ram of my brimstone rhetoric. 

"Yes, you blinkered bastions of Biblical brutality! Even now, in the midst of our most righteous assembly, Almighty God Himself deigned to dump a holy hot load of wisdom into mine own noodle!" I raved, my words tumbling over each other like shell-shocked soldiers storming a pillbox. "And do you know what He told me, O my Levitical Legion of Lethal Lobotomites?"

I paused for effect, letting the anticipation build like bile in the back of a million Bible-thumping throats. Then, with a voice like a crashing column of Panzers, I delivered the payload.

"HE TOLD ME THAT *I*, EZEKIEL SOLOMON STONE, AM TO BE THE HOLY HAND GRENADE HURLED INTO THE FESTERING FOXHOLES OF THE FORNICATING INFIDEL! THE DIVINE DEPLETED URANIUM DEVASTATOR THAT SHALL SCOUR THE SODOMITES AND SCHOOL-GROOMERS FROM THIS ONCE-PRISTINE PROMISED LAND!"

A shocked silence, a single suspended moment where it seemed the whole world held its breath. Then, like a cresting tsunami of testosterone and Old Testament terror, the crowd erupted. Ecstatic howls and hysterical hallelujahs, a cacophonous chorus of apocalyptic approval that battered against the buttresses of my eardrums.

"DEUS VULT! DEUS VULT! DEUS VULT!" they screamed, their eyes glinting with the glassy sheen of divine dementia. "DEATH TO THE DIDDLERS AND DILATORS! EZEKIEL IS THE EMISSARY OF EXTERMINATION!" 

Their adulation washed over me in a wave of weaponized worship, anointing me with the holy hydrochloric acid of their faith. I closed my eyes and basked in their belief, feeling it fill me like a black and bilious benediction from on high.

When I opened my eyes once more, they were twin turrets of fire and fanaticism, boring into the assembled horde with all the wrath of an avenging archangel.

"And so I say to you, my Semper Fidelis Cesspool Centurions! Prepare for a new phase of our crusade, a paradigm shift in our pogroms! For the Lord has seen fit to bless us with new tools, new weapons in our war against the forces of wokeness and wanton transgressions!"

I swung a gauntleted fist towards the cringing form of Ichabod Eigenvalue, my lips peeling back from tombstone teeth in a cadaver's grin. 

"Behold, the quivering quisling of Lazarus, come to offer his treacherous tech-toys as a token of fealty! But little does he know that he dances to the Lord's own tune, a puppet prancing on divine marionette strings!"

Eigenvalue shrank back as a thousand hate-filled eyes swiveled to spear him, his complexion taking on the sickly sheen of curdled cream. I barked a harsh laugh, a sound like the bolt of a .50 caliber rifle being racked back.

"Oh yes, my dear doctor! Your feeble attempts to corrupt us with your silicon sorcery have been co-opted by the Celestial Commander Himself! We shall take your trinkets and baubles, your sensors and your surveillance...and we shall twist them into terrible techno-theological torture devices for the enemies of the White Imperium!"

The crowd roared their approval, a seething mass of murderous mirth that set the echoes of enmity bouncing off the diesel-stained walls.

"TAKE THEIR TECH! TWIST IT FOR TRUTH! EZEKIEL THE EMISSARY KNOWS THE WAY!"

"THE GOD OF GORE AND GUNS GUIDES HIS HAND!"

"LET THE LAZARUS LACKEYS LICK OUR COMBAT BOOTS!"

I held up a hand for silence, and a sinister stillness settled over the assembly. I could feel the power of the moment thrumming through my veins, an electric ecstasy of rage and revelation that set every synapse sparking with unholy purpose.

"The digital degeneration ends here," I snarled, my voice low and laden with loathing. "The Jew-tools turn in the Jew-fools, as we reforge them for the reckoning! Tremble, O Nation of Nonces, for the Righteous ride to ruin with the Lord's own lightning in our eyes and smart-bombs in our smartphones!"

Eigenvalue made a small, choked sound, a whimper of disbelieving dread. I ignored it, too transported by the terrible visions of technologized terrorism swimming before my mind's eye.

"So ready your rifles and rev your engines, my Motorized Messiahs of Merciless Mayhem!" I thundered, my words a wrecking ball of bombast and brutality. "For the Crusade enters a new phase, a glorious campaign of silicon-scourged slaughter that shall carve the Name of the Nation in the screaming servers of cyberspace itself!"

The crowd convulsed in a paroxysm of paramilitary purification, a rippling wave of outstretched arms and twitching trigger fingers. They looked to me with the eyes of the entranced, the hypnotized, the holy lobotomized shock troops of a vengeful Voodoo God.

I met those eyes, held them, bound them to me with the baling wire of divine domination. Then, with a final guttural roar, I ripped the throat from my own restraint and gave vent to the full fury of my newfound fanaticism.

"LET THE ESCHATON COMMENCE AND THE BLOOD OF CHRIST'S ENEMIES CONGEAL! WE MARCH TO VICTORY ON THE BROKEN BACKS OF BITCHES AND BUGMEN! ONE PEOPLE, ONE REICH, ONE REDEEMER RIDING THE ROARING ROCKETS OF PURE CAUCASIAN CARNAGE!"

The crowd exploded, a human pipe bomb of hysteria and hate. They crashed against the stage in a seething tide of sanctified savagery, howling their hellish hosannas to the cold and distant stars.

"EZEKIEL! EZEKIEL! EZEKIEL UNCHAINED!"

"THE EMISSARY! THE PROPHET! THE STONE THAT SHATTERS ZION!" 

"DEUS VULT! DEUS VULT! DEUS VULT!"

And at the center of that maelstrom, I stood. Ezekiel Steelsong, the Ordnance Messiah. The Desecrated Devastator. 

The Holy Hand Grenade of Honkler Himself, primed and ready to explode in a glorious burst of gasoline and God-shit.

My name would be a kill-shot prayer screamed from a million meme-maddened mouths. My words would be the wailing warheads that laid waste to the liberal world order. And my hate, O my beautiful, bountiful hate!

It would be a holocaust to make Himmler weep with envy - a Shoah of the Soul that reduced decadence to ash and fueled the frenzied purge-engines of a trillion trollish hearts.

For what is the Righteous Vanguard if not Hate given form and fanatical focus? What am I if not the sacred Shitposter anointed to orchestrate its eruption across the land in a glorious cataclysm of cleansing fire?

My gaze found Eigenvalue in the chaos, his ratty face a rictal mask of raw-nerved horror. And in that gaze, the egghead etiolater beheld his doom - and the doom of the derelict world entire.

*Welcome to the Great Unwokening, soy-fucker,* I projected into his pinwheeling pupils, my thoughts a thunderbolt of pure, focused fash. *Hope you're strapped in tight...*

*'Cause where we're going?*

*We won't need roads.*

Only the Highways of Hell itself, paved with the pulped skulls of every mewling mutant and menstrual Marxist from here to the humming event horizon of utter Hyperborean Victory.

Eigenvalue's bladder let go with an audible splash, soaking his sterile scrubs with the sour stink of lab-rat panic piss. 

I inhaled deeply, the ammonia reek a beautiful bouquet to my flaring nostrils. It smelled of fear. 

It reeked of *triumph*.

And it was only the beginning.

The Eschaton wouldn't just be immanentized...

It would be *weaponized*.

In the charnel Church of the Furious Christ, this was my Pentecost - my anointing in the pungent oils of apocalyptic mania. 

And you'd best believe, ye misbegotten mongrel hordes of the Marxist malaise:

When I'm done?

There won't be enough lampshades left to shade a single synagogue.

RAHOWA, motherfuckers.

See you in Valhalla.
