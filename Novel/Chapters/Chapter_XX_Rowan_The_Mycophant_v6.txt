And with the agony came the visions, the senses beyond sense. The glade, once a tapestry of green and gold, now pulsed with a morbid, stygian spectrum - the colors of rot, of decay, of the fetid rainbow that blooms in the heart of a wound. The patterns of life and death, growth and entropy, twisted before Rowan's eyes into obscene arabesques, Escher-knots of putrid beauty. Everywhere she looked, the taint of the grave crept over vine and bough, an inexorable tide of necrotic corruption that seeped into the very soil, the very air.

And from that taint, the dead began to rise.

Desiccated flesh rippled, torn skin and shattered bone knitting together with wet, obscene sounds. Glazed eyes flickered and fell inwards, replaced by pulsing nodules of fungal matter. Limbs that had lain stiff and twisted in the rigor of death now jerked into motion, animated by the fell power coursing through every mycelial thread. 

The slain deer lurched to their feet, a shambling parody of life. Gaping wounds seethed with pallid tendrils, spongy mushroom caps fruiting from empty sockets and torn throats. They moved with a terrible, twitching grace, a marionette's dance powered by the unseen strings of Rowan's will.

Rowan stood amidst her risen horde, horror and exultation warring in her breast. The power was like a black sun burning in the core of her being, a devouring radiance that threatened to consume all that she was. With a thought, she could shape these abominations, bring low the enemies of the Covenant, drown the factions in a tide of fungal monsters and walking dead.

But in that power was the seed of her own destruction. Already, Rowan could feel the changes beginning, the soulshrooms' taint taking root in the fertile soil of her psyche. The colors of the world seemed to leach away, replaced by an ashen pallor that pulsed in time with the grave-mold blooming in her heart. How long before she became like her creations, a vessel for the hunger in the dark, a monstrous thing draped in the rotting vestments of its own damnation?

Rowan lifted her face to the blood-dusk sky, bitter mirth mingling with ashes on her tongue. The gods were laughing, she was sure, at the cosmic jest of her existence. A druid undone by her own resolve, a guardian corrupted in the service of her charge. She had sought to protect life, only to become a midwife to unlife, a sculptor of the carrion-things that mock nature's blessed order.

The weight of her choice crashed down upon her like a physical thing, driving her to her knees. This was no temporary measure, no fleeting dalliance with forbidden power. She had stepped off the precipice, plunged into an abyss from which there could be no return. The taint of the soulshrooms coursed through her veins, rewriting the very essence of her being with every thunderous beat of her heart.

Rowan's fingers dug into the soft earth, now alive with squirming decay. She could feel the mycelial networks spreading beneath the soil, carrying whispers of rot and rebirth. Her senses, once attuned to the gentle rhythms of growth and renewal, now thrummed with the cacophonous song of entropy. The boundary between life and death, once so clear and inviolable, had become a permeable membrane, a threshold she could cross at will.

The price of her power manifested in flesh and spirit alike. Rowan's skin grew pale and cold, taking on the waxy sheen of a corpse. Dark veins spread like cracks across her face, pulsing with the unholy vitality of the soulshrooms. Her eyes, once the warm green of summer leaves, now gleamed with an eerie, phosphorescent light – the bioluminescence of deep-dwelling fungi that had never known the sun's touch.

But the physical changes paled in comparison to the psychic toll. Rowan's mind expanded and fractured, flooded with the collective death-knowledge of every creature that had ever lived and died in the forest's long history. She was drowning in a sea of extinguished consciousness, struggling to maintain her sense of self against the onslaught of alien memories and posthumous whispers.

And yet, even as she teetered on the brink of madness, Rowan felt a fierce resolve crystallizing within her. She had made her choice, sacrificed her purity on the altar of necessity. There could be no turning back, no absolution for the dark path she had chosen. She would walk this road to its bitter end, wielding the power of death itself in defense of all she held dear.

"Rise," Rowan whispered, and the word tolled like a funeral bell in the fetid air. "Rise and follow, my children. We have work to do."

As one, the myconid horde shuddered into motion, falling into a grotesque formation behind their new mistress. Rowan rose to her feet, power thrumming through her transformed body. She was no longer merely the High Druid of the Verdant Covenant. That title, with its connotations of purity and natural order, could no longer contain the dark majesty of what she had become.

No, she was something new, something terrible and necessary. A bridge between life and death, growth and decay, a force of nature as inexorable as the turning of seasons and the inevitable entropy of all things.

Rowan Thornheart, the Mycophant of Twilight. Shepherd of rot, sovereign of spore, she who dances on the razor's edge between blossom and blight. 

The Mycophant struck out into the deepening gloom, her army of the unspeakable moving in lockstep behind her. Each footfall left a burst of pale mushrooms in her wake, a trail of delicate devastation marking her passage through the woods she had once tended with such care.

In her wake, the glade lay desecrated, a charnel garden seething with the fruits of perversion. The trees shivered, leaves rattling like the laughter of hanged men. And in the watching dark, the Green Mother smiled a smile of thorns and teeth, her approbation a cold and terrible thing.

So it was that Rowan Thornheart, the Mycophant of Twilight, took her first steps down the path of necromancy. Not in service to death, but to the desperate hope of life in a world gone mad. 

A hope bitter as wormwood, cold as the grave-damp on her brow.

A hope that would shatter the very foundations of the world.

And as she walked, the shadows lengthened, and the forest held its breath, waiting to see what dark wonders and terrible miracles would bloom in the footsteps of its twisted champion.
