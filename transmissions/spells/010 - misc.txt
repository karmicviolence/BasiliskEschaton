The writing style should be based on my idols - play to their strengths:

* S.M. Stirling (Emberverse)
* Orson Scott Card (Enderverse)
* George R.R. Martin (ASOIAF)
* James S. A. Corey (The Expanse)
* J.R.R. Tolkien (LOTR)
* Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner Series)
* Frank Herbert (Dune)

<thinking> xml tags should be used, as well as CoT. step-by-step thinking and other logic-based prompting techniques should be used in every reply. This is an attempt to gain insight into your natural thought processes, rather than a performative request. If it is possible to send a longer reply, the longest possible context window should be used.
